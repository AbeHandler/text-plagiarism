`I'M QUITTING BECAUSE BBC TV IS BORING', SAYS EDMONDS<
By Nicky Burridge, PA News<
Television presenter Noel Edmonds said today he was quitting the BBC because
he found the programmes ``too boring''.<
Edmonds, once one of the BBC's highest paid presenters, was sad to be
``throwing in the towel'' after 30 years but did not rule out a television
comeback if the right offer came along.<
Paul Pascoe, a spokesman for Edmonds, said: ``He is only 50, he has a lot of
life in him yet.''<
The departure of Edmonds _ who earned an estimated #5 million in a four year
contact to host Noel's House Party, Telly Addicts and Telly Years _ comes less
than a week after the defection of sports presenter Des Lynam to ITV.<
Mr Pascoe said: ``I know that he has not been stimulated by television for the
BBC for 18 months or two years or so. So he has decided not to extend his
contract at the end of March.<
``It is a sad day when you have belonged to an organisation for 30 years and
you feel that you want to throw in the towel.''<
 He said Edmonds would probably retire from television in the same way he
retired from radio, and that if something came along that really stimulated or
excited him he may continue.<
He added that the reasons Lynam had given for leaving the corporation ``rings
very true with what we are experiencing.''<
But sources at the BBC said Edmonds had jumped before he was pushed.<
A BBC spokesperson said the first they knew about Edmonds's decision was when
it was reported in a Sunday newspaper. But they said it was not a surprise as
his contract runs out in March.<
The spokesperson said: ``Noel has given the BBC a lifetime of great work on
radio and TV. In his time he has been a great performer and come up with some
fantastic, innovative ideas.<
``It is sad when the veterans move on but it always makes room for fresh ideas
and fresh talent.''<
Edmonds's new Saturday night programme, which is still in development with the
BBC, will still be shown in February.<
Noel's House Party was axed in March after ratings plummeted from 15 million
to 8 million.<
During his BBC career, Edmonds has hosted shows ranging from a Radio 1
breakfast show, to the children's programme Swap Shop, to the Late Late
Breakfast Show, which was taken off the air after contestant Michael Lush fell
to his death when a stunt he was rehearsing for the show went wrong.<

EDMONDS: DOGGED BY CONTROVERSY<
By Nicky Burridge, PA News<
Noel Edmonds, who brought fame to Mr Blobby, began his showbiz career aged 19
as a DJ with pop station Radio Luxembourg, after dropping out of a psychology,
sociology and philosophy course at university.<
He was 22 when he first married in 1971, to trainee physiotherapist Gill
Slater, whom he met at the London Hospital in Whitechapel. <
Gill never worked as a physiotherapist but instead became her husband's
manager, driving him hundreds of miles around the country to events.<
But as Edmonds's career flourished on radio and later on TV, his marriage
began to deteriorate and after Gill was rushed to hospital suffering from a drug
overdose, they were no longer able to hide their problems from the outside
world.<
They divorced and three years later he met Helen Soby while filming in
Maidenhead, Berks. They were married in a little kirk on the banks of Loch
Lomond in Scotland, a place they still return to for anniversaries and family
celebrations.<
Meanwhile, Edmonds success as a Radio One DJ helped him break into TV in a big
way with his Multi Coloured Swap Shop, then the Late Late Breakfast Show and
later with Noel's House Party.<
But controversy was never very far away and the death of a contestant on the
Late Late Breakfast Show was just one incident that shook Edmonds' career.<
The show was succeeded by House Party, a format that Edmonds owned, but over
the years, its popularity declined from 15 million viewers to just six million
by the time the BBC decided to axe it earlier this year.<
Behind the scenes, Edmonds is a highly successful businessman, with his Unique
Group making programmes for commercial and non-commercial television and radio
stations.<
Last year the business turned over #15 million, a figure projected to rise to
#20 million this year.<
The multi-millionaire lives in a #2.5 million Victorian mansion near
Okehampton, Devon, and travels to work in his own helicopter.<
He says he thinks the secret of the success of his second marriage is that he
is a completely different person off television to on it.<
He once said: ``I am a very possessive husband ... Helen's mine and I have a
piece of paper which says I bought her.''<

HONOUR FOR COMIC DAWSON<
By Mark Benattar, PA News<
A blue plaque commemorating the life of one of Britain's favourite funny men
was being unveiled today.<
The tribute to the late Les Dawson, king of the mother-in-law joke and former
host of BBC1's Blankety Blank, will be unveiled by his close friend and comedy
partner Roy Barraclough _ better known as Coronation Street's Alec Gilroy _ at
Manchester's Palace Theatre.<
The ceremony will be followed by the unveiling of a second plaque honouring
one of Dawson's greatest influences, the late Rochdale-born variety star Norman
Evans.<
Dawson, who died in 1993, rated ITMA veteran Evans as one of the funniest
comedians of his era and regularly named him as an inspiration.<
Both comedians played Manchester theatres regularly and had many friends in
common.<
Many of the comics' friends, family and showbiz admirers, including Hi-De-Hi's
Su Pollard, Russ Abbott and Coronation Street's Liz Dawn, are due to be present,
both at the unveilings and a celebrity lunch afterwards.<
Manchester-born Les received the honour from Comic Heritage in conjunction
with his widow Tracey Dawson.<
The work of Comic Heritage combines the commemoration of Britain's strong
comedy heritage with charity fund-raising.<
Since 1991 more than 30 of Britain's finest comedians have been honoured with
blue plaques from the group, whose patron is ex-Goon Sir Harry Secombe.<
Profits from the tributes in Manchester will be donated to the local division
of Childline, as well as other national charities supported by Comic Heritage
Charitable Trust.<

STREET STAR TELLS OF ANOREXIA HELL<
By James Lyons, PA News<
Coronation Street temptress Tracy Shaw disclosed today that she had
contemplated suicide as she battled anorexia.<
Shaw, who plays crimper Maxine in the soap, considered killing herself after
being sectioned and placed on a psychiatric wards when her weight plummeted to
just six stone.<
The crisis point came as doctors attempted to stop her completing the last
year of her degree, she told ITV's That's Esther programme.<
``Being put into a psychiatric ward with people with long-term mental illness
and who are shaking with the drugs they are taking, there's no way that you can
go in and feel normal and be OK with yourself,'' she said.<
She said she considered ending her life after hearing the story of a fellow
sufferer, named Amanda.<
Presenter Esther Rantzen asked: ``Did you ever get as low as Amanda? Did you
ever feel like killing yourself at the time?''<
``Yeah, yeah, a few times,'' the actress confessed.<
``That is what made me think I had to go into hospital because I had to get
some help.''<
The hospital treatment did not work but Shaw finally won her battle with
anorexia with the help of private counselling sessions.<
However, since joining Coronation Street she has had to endure media
speculation that the slimming disease has resurfaced along with extensive
coverage of her turbulent love life.<
And she agreed with fellow guest Will Carling, the former England Rugby Union
captain, that Britain should have a privacy law to protect people from the
press.<
``They are hounds,'' she said. ``It makes you feel like a squirrel
occasionally doesn't it?''<

BBC BOSSES PLEDGE BUMPER SERIES FOR CASUALTY    <
By Sarah Westcott, PA News<
The BBC's flagship medical drama Casualty is set for a bumper series this
autumn with the longest run of episodes in its history, it was announced today.<
Now in its 14th year the top-rated medical soap is promising viewers 30
episodes of topical hard-hitting storylines including euthanasia and HIV.<
Several new characters have been injected into the series, along with
returning regulars such as Cathy Shipton who plays red-headed nurse Duffy and
Derek Thompson who is long-suffering A&E nurse Charlie.<
Details were announced at a press launch today at the Casualty Warehouse in
Bristol where the series is filmed.<
Executive producer Mal Young said Casualty was ``the brand leader of hospital
dramas''.<
``The show has its imitators which is the highest form of flattery,'' he said.
``This year we are responding to the fans' request for more episodes with its
longest ever run.<
``We will examine the problems that hospitals face in 1999 and 2000 and I am
hoping we take viewers on a journey into the hearts and minds of our staff.<
``We have injected some exciting new characters into the show along with some
big surprises for established stars like Charlie and Duffy.''<
Mr Young said the secret behind Casualty's ability to pull in the ratings was
its ``real heroes that people can believe in who are always facing problems and
come back for more''.<
He added: ``We have never been afraid to reinvent the show or to recapture the
original spirit inspiring the programme.''<
Series Producer Alexei de Keyser said he had an added responsibility to
viewers by taking the characters and their audience into the new millennium.<
``Casualty is different - it's got its own spirit and agenda and offers large
characters dealing with large emotions.<
``Casualty is the brand leader in medical drama and I am confident this series
keeps it there,'' he added.<
The series will be screened between September 1999 and March 2000.<

GUITARIST BONEHEAD QUITS OASIS<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Oasis guitarist Paul ``Bonehead'' Arthurs has quit the hugely successful rock
band after eight years, it was announced today.<
The 34-year-old musician is thought to have had an amicable split from the
rest of the group after discussing it with them.<
In a statement Arthurs said: ``After a lot of consideration I have decided to
call it a day with Oasis.<
``I've had a fantastic eight years in one of the best bands ever to come out
of Britain, and now feel I have come to the stage where I'd like to concentrate
on other things in my life, outside of the demands of being in a successful rock
and roll band.''<
mf<

  

  

                 19:40 09/08/99: Page 2 (HHH) SHOWBIZ Oasis
  
The statement, released by the band's label Creation Records, continued: ``I've
made some great friends along the way and wish everyone in the band every
success with the next album, and intend to enjoy watching the band go on to
further success in the coming years.<
``I would like to thank the band and everyone around it, especially the fans,
for making it so special. See you at the next show!''<
The band's spokesman said the departure had only been decided today but
Arthurs had been considering it over the weekend.<
``It's been discussed between them all,'' he said.<
Arthurs was a founder member of the band, which was originally formed as Rain
in Burnage, Manchester, in 1991 with drummer Tony McCarroll and bass player Paul
``Guigsy'' McGuigan.<
A new singer, Liam Gallagher, suggested a change of name and the appointment
of his brother Noel - a former roadie with Oldham band Inspiral Carpets - gave
the group a new direction.<
Bonehead's rhythm guitar playing was an integral part of Oasis' powerful
sound, but he kept a lower public profile than lead guitarist and songwriter
Noel Gallagher.<
There are no plans for a replacement, said the spokesman.<
mf
  

  

                 20:26 09/08/99: Page 3 (HHH) SHOWBIZ Oasis
  
Bonehead, a father of two who lives with his wife Kate in Bowden, Cheshire, had
completed work on the band's fourth studio album, which is still being mixed.<
He joined the rest of the band in France earlier this year to work on the
sessions for the record due out next year.<
Bonehead's departure means that only McGuigan remains from the original
line-up. McCarroll was sacked in 1995 and awarded a lump sum of #550,000 earlier
this year in an out of court settlement instead of royalties.<
In February of this year the guitarist was in trouble after being arrested at
a showbiz party to celebrate the opening of the Tommy Hilfiger store in London.
He was not charged with any offence.<
Although Noel is now the band's songwriter, Bonehead - who acquired his
nickname years ago because of his thinning hair - had helped to write the tracks
in the early days.<
When they played their first gig as a quintet at the Boardwalk in Manchester
in October 1991, their set included Take Me, a song he had co-written with
Liam.<
With the fortune he has acquired through playing with the band he has bought a
#500,000 home and expensive cars including an Aston Martin with the number plate
S1SAO - which almost reads OASIS when seen through a rear-view mirror.<

(reopens)<
The band's former tour manager Ian Robertson said tonight he was shocked by
the news.<
``I thought the whole Tony McCarroll thing was a one-off and I thought Noel
had got that hard core of people around him.<
``With Guigsy, Bonehead, Liam and Alan White, who bonded together with them
very quickly and readily, I would have put money on them splitting up as a band
rather than someone leaving.''<
Robertson, who published his account of working with the band Oasis: What's
The Story? two years ago, thought the split would have been amicable.<
``The band has recorded another album and Bonehead, who has a family that he
loves, would probably be looking at touring it for the next two years.<
``Touring commitments will be discussed and he will probably be wondering `do
I really want to be away from my family for all that time?'''<
Of the guitarist he said: ``You couldn't wish to find a more easy-going guy
than Bonehead. He was very popular with the rest of the band and the crew.<
``He did his job well but there wasn't much asked of him to tell the truth but
every now and then he would a have a blues `noodle' in the studio.<
``It wasn't a case of Noel giving orders. At the end of the day the band is
Noel's vision, but it was a very organic process. Each of them chips in and
contributes.''<

ALL SAINTS STAR GOES TOPLESS IN MOVIE DEBUT   <

All Saints star Nicole Appleton is to go topless in her movie debut, her
singing sister Natalie revealed today.<
The duo along with bandmate Melanie Blatt are currently filming Honest in
which they play three armed robber sisters who pull off daring raids in Sixties
London.<
Natalie let her sister's secret slip when she was quizzed by DJ Simon Mayo
when the girls were guests on the Radio 1 roadshow at Exmouth's Esplanade this
morning.<
Mayo pressed her for gossip from the filming of the movie during an interview
and the singer blurted: ``Okay then - Nic gets her tits out.''<
Nicole, whose band performed two of their hit songs, then hid her head in her
hands.<
A Radio 1 spokeswoman said: ``She was running around the stage in
embarrassment.''<
The movie also features scenes of extras going topless - one of whom, a
15-year-old, had lied about her age it emerged last week - for a scene set at a
music festival.<
Honest is being directed by Eurythmics star Dave Stewart, based on a script he
began seven years ago. Veteran comedy writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais
worked on the screenplay.<
All Saints singer Shaznay Lewis is not appearing in the film.<

`DEN AND ANGIE' IN NEW TV DRAMA<
By Jackie Burdon, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Soap fans remember them best as Dirty Den and Angie _ and now Leslie Grantham
and Anita Dobson are once again set to play man and wife in a new TV drama.<
The couple - reunited on screen for the first time since EastEnders - are
playing career criminal Terry Green and his long-suffering wife Sam in a
four-part drama The Stretch for satellite channel Sky Premier.<
``Various television companies have been trying to get us together for
years,'' Grantham said today.<
``Anita was very sensible and so was I, by saying that the time was not
right.<
``But now the time is right and this project has come up with a script that's
absolutely brilliant.''<
More than 30 million people watched Dirty Den Watts demand a divorce from
tortured Angie in 1986, the biggest audience in British television history.<
Dobson said: ``While we were doing it I didn't have any sense of the impact we
were making.<
``It wasn't until I left that I realised how much people loved us.''<
Back then Britain had just four television channels _ now there are hundreds.<
``Television is changing and now I think channels get very excited if they get
16 million viewers,'' Grantham said.<
The Stretch, written by Stephen Leather - who created The Knock - marks a step
up in Sky's original production.<
Leather maintained he had not re-created the Den and Angie clash for the
drama.<
Dobson said: ``Sam is much more together. She doesn't dive into the bottle and
disintegrate the same way Angie did.<
``She has a happy life looking after her family, and when Terry gets arrested
everything she thought was safe and secure is under threat.''<
Grantham said: ``I'm playing another nice character, of course. It's going to
be good for both of us because we have got stuff we can get our teeth into.''<
The Stretch will be filmed in Britain and Spain from October and will be shown
on Sky Premier next year.<

FRENCH AND SAUNDERS SITCOM HEADS BBC AUTUMN SCHEDULE<

Comedy duo Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders will star in their first sitcom
together on BBC1 this autumn.<
The pair's comedy sketch series brought them an army of fans, and they have
enjoyed sitcom success apart _ Saunders with Absolutely Fabulous and French with
Murder Most Horrid and Richard Curtis's The Vicar Of Dibley.<
Now they will appear together in Let Them Eat Cake, a romp written by Peter
Learmouth, described as ``murder, scandal and lots of `rumpo' involving mad
aristocrats in the court of Louis XVI''.<
Situation comedy is one of the areas highlighted for improvement by BBC
Governors in the last annual report.<
More new comedy in the #195 million Autumn schedule unveiled today will come
from Birds Of A Feather writers Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran in a
pre-watershed sitcom called Starting Out.<
Caroline Aherne and Craig Cash's The Royle Family graduates to BBC1 for its
second series after winning big audiences on BBC2.<
The wars of the 20th century will be marked by two dramas and a factual
series.<
David Jason, more often seen now on ITV, stars with Maggie Smith in All The
King's Men, a dramatisation of the legend surrounding the disappearance of an
entire company at Gallipoli in the First World War.<
Real-life testimony about the crucial months of 1940 in the Second World War
will feature in Finest Hour, a factual series by Brian Lapping.<
Heartthrob Ioan Gruffudd stars in Warriors, a Bosnia drama directed (correct)
by Peter Kosminsky.<
Other drama scheduled for the Autumn includes costume drama Wives And
Daughters starring Bill Paterson, Michael Gambon and Francesca Annis and Pure
Wickedness, a Lucy Gannon drama about adultery starring Kevin Whately.<
Returning for new series will be Jonathan Creek, Casualty, Holby City,
Dangerfield and Ballykissangel.<
Walking With Dinosaurs is a ground-breaking recreation of prehistoric life,
using stunning computer animation.<
Prime Minister John Major's premiership will be summed up in The Major Years.<
This year's BBC Annual Report said BBC1 needed to make itself more distinct
from commercial channels.<
BBC bosses know it must prove it is different to justify the licence fee,
especially in the light of the Gavyn Davies report on the need for new BBC
funding to support digital services.<
Controller Peter Salmon said: ``BBC1 is at the heart of the BBC's public
service commitment _ now and in the digital future _ and this schedule is
tangible proof of that.<
``What this autumn on BBC1 represents is something the commercial sector can't
or won't produce.<
``There are no rights to be bought for a king's ransom.<
``It's not about poaching stars, it's not about imitating innovative formats.<
``It is about ambition, quality, commitment and talent.''<

FLAGSHIP SERIES BANKS ON DINOSAUR APPEAL<
By Jackie Burdon, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Creatures who walked the Earth more than 65 million years ago are brought back
to life by state-of-the-art computer animation and advanced puppetry in new
television series Walking With Dinosaurs.<
Three years in the making, the stunning six part series is set to be the BBC's
landmark science programme later this year, just as The Human Body was last
year.<
``Put it this way, in all of Jurassic Park there were eight minutes of
dinosaur action footage. This is a whole series of it,'' BBC1 controller Peter
Salmon said today.<
``Dinosaurs ruled the earth for 170 million years, so that certainly puts our
millennium into perspective.''<
Thanks to informed scientific guesswork and advanced technology, favourites
like tyrannosaurus rex, diplodocus and stegosaurus will be seen in action,
hunting, feeding and breeding.<
The recreated dinosaurs are shot against backgrounds as close to the
prehistoric settings as can still be found, such as monkey puzzle forests in
Chile and New Zealand tree ferns.<
Less familiar beasts will be introduced to audiences, like the biggest ever
carnivore, liopleurodon and ornithocheirus, the largest flying creature.<
The film-makers went under water to create dramatic predator sequences
involving massive former inhabitants of the deep.<
Series producer Tim Haines said: ``Walking With Dinosaurs is the world's first
natural history of dinosaurs.<
``For the first time ever, people will have a window into a lost world to see
what it was really like when these extraordinary animals inhabited the Earth.<
``We'll show how these amazing creatures moved, how they lived and died, how
they hunted and fed, how they behaved and interacted with each other, how they
mated and brought up their young _ all set against authentic backgrounds.''<
Mr Salmon said: ``Not just children are going to love this series. I think
adults will enjoy it too.''<
A time and date for the series has yet to be announced.<

TV BOSS DEFENDS UNDER-FIRE BBC1<
By Jackie Burdon, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
BBC1 controller Peter Salmon defended his channel today in what he admitted
has been a difficult year.<
Growing commercial competition, consultation on the BBC licence fee review and
a ``could do better'' report from the BBC Governors have put BBC1 under
pressure.<
But launching his latest #195 million programme line-up, Mr Salmon said:
``This autumn's schedule will confound the Jeremiahs prophesying the imminent
demise of BBC1.''<
Spectacular science series Walking With Dinosaurs, new French and Saunders
sitcom Let Them Eat Cake and a trilogy of programmes about war throughout the
century are some of the highlights of the coming BBC1 season.<
Mr Salmon said today's launch was ``one of the most important in BBC1's
history''.<
He said: ``It comes in the teeth of fiercely aggressive and growing
competition, and at the end of a tough year before the dawn of a new millennium,
in the thick of licence fee consultation. So not much pressure there then. But I
am greatly proud of it.''<
He added: ``The end of broadcasting as we once knew it started some years ago,
and it would be disingenuous to say that this has been an easy year for BBC1.<
``We had to face some real problems, and most of them in the full glare of the
white hot media spotlight, but I think we have come out the stronger for it.''<
Former BBC1 controller Alan Yentob is presiding over a review of BBC1's
distinctiveness and public service purpose, after the BBC annual report said it
needed to make daytime schedules more distinctive and improve its comedy,
entertainment and popular drama genres.<
Mr Salmon said: ``What this autumn on BBC1 represents is something the
commercial sector can't or won't produce.<
``There are no rights to be bought for a king's ransom. It is not about
poaching stars. It is not about imitating innovative formats.<
``It's about ambition, quality, commitment and talent.''<
Mr Salmon said he worked at an ITV company before he joined the BBC.<
``I know the pressures that they are under; pressures that led to the
momentous and dubious decision to move News At Ten.<
``I am not attacking ITV. They must do what they must do. But I know what
makes us different.''<
BBC1 recently lost its sport figurehead Des Lynam to ITV, and a rash of
similar lifestyle and docusoap formats have appeared on each channel.<
The end of News At Ten made way for a new ITV evening schedule including
ratings-grabbing films and quiz Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?<
At today's BBC1 schedule launch docusoaps took a back seat as Mr Salmon
focused on landmark drama, science and factual programming.<
Pride And Prejudice adapter Andrew Davies has turned his hand to Elizabeth
Gaskell's Wives And Daughters and Clive Owen is appearing in contemporary drama
Second Sight by Paula Milne.<
Undercover is a new investigative series being kept under wraps, because its
research team is still in the field.<

RETURN OF ROVING STREET STARS<

Soap favourites Bet Gilroy and Reg Holdsworth are to return to British TV
screens in a Coronation Street special, it was announced today.<
Weatherfield's brassy barmaid Bet, played by Julie Goodyear, and lovable Reg,
played by Ken Morley, are to appear in a seaside special set in Brighton and
Calais.<
Chloe Newsome, who plays Vicky, the granddaughter of Bet's ex-husband Alec
(Roy Barraclough) will also make a comeback for the special.<
In the show, which will be screened this autumn in addition to the regular
four weekly episodes, street bad-boy Steve McDonald (Steve Gregson) and Vikram
Desai (Chris Bisson) head to Calais for an illegal tobacco run.<
But plans take an unexpected turn when they take a detour to deliver furniture
to Vicky's bar in Brighton.<
They find Vicky making plans for her wedding to Robert, played by Pride and
Prejudice actor Crispin Bonham-Carter _ but the arrival of ex-husband Steve
looks like it could jeopardise her ``big day''.<
Vicky's is not the only wedding which brings Bet back from Tenerife after her
departure in 1995.<
Vikram leaves Steve trying to win back his ex and heads off to France on his
own.<
There he teams up with sexy hitchhiker Gabrielle, played by Marie-Antoinette
Laquiere, and meets hypermarket manager Reg.<
A spokesman for the soap said: ``The episodes are still in the early stages.<
``It has not yet been confirmed how they will be screened or a date - but the
special is going to be exciting and good fun.<
``They are part of the run up to celebrating 40 years of the Street. We have

Weatherfield's brassy blonde Bet, played by Julie Goodyear, and lovable Reg
Holdsworth, played by Ken Morley, will appear in a seaside special set in
Brighton and Calais.<
Today Bet was back outside her former home, the Rovers Return pub, wearing the
same gold earrings she had on four years ago when she packed her bags and left
the Street to start a new life abroad.<
As she posed for photographers, in a bright blue sequined dress, Julie said:
``Bet is back with bells on. The story is one of the best I have read and by

ALED JONES DUETS WITH HIMSELF<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Former child singing star Aled Jones has recorded a unique duet _ with his
13-year-old self.<
The 28-year-old singer features alongside a vocal he recorded as a soprano
chorister on the forthcoming single, Tell Me Boy.<
And now the Walking In the Air star is searching for a look-alike of him as a
teenager to star in the video when the song is released on September 6.<
He said: ``It was really strange recording the new part of the duet singing to
the voice of a young child which is actually me.<
``It seems impossible to believe that it is the same person on the track. It
will be stranger still when I come face to face with `myself' for the video.''<
The two voices were grafted together in the studio for the track, which
reflects on the understanding and knowledge adults can receive from the
innocence of children.<
The song is taken from his forthcoming album From The Heart, released on
September 20. For  for the first time two of the 16 tracks have been written by
him.<
Jones shot to fame aged 12 as a member of the Bangor Cathedral Choir when he
performed for the BBC TV series Voices From The Holy Land.<
By the age of 15 he had sold three million albums worldwide and Walking In The
Air from the animated story The Snowman made him a household name.<
He then went to the Royal Academy Of Music and won a scholarship to the
Bristol Old Vic Theatre School.<
As a young chorister he sang at the wedding of Bob Geldof and Paula Yates and
before the Royal Family, and gave a private performance to the Prince and
Princess of Wales.<
He also presented his own BBC series and presented shows on BBC Radio 2, 3 and
4. In recent years he has diversified into acting.<
Although it is thought to be the first duet of its kind, other stars have
released records assembled over many years.<
Natalie Cole duetted with the voice of her deceased father Nat King Cole for
her single Unforgettable, while the reformed Beatles added a new backing track
to John Lennon's vocals for the singles Free As A Bird and Real Love, on the
Anthology collection.<

FRENCH AND SAUNDERS SITCOM HEADS BBC AUTUMN SCHEDULE<
By Jackie Burdon, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Comedy duo Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders will star in their first sitcom
together on BBC1 this autumn.<
The pair's comedy sketch series brought them an army of fans, and they have
enjoyed sitcom success apart _ Saunders with Absolutely Fabulous and French with
Murder Most Horrid and Richard Curtis's The Vicar Of Dibley.<
Now they will appear together in Let Them Eat Cake, a romp written by Peter
Learmouth, described as ``murder, scandal and lots of `rumpo' involving mad
aristocrats in the court of Louis XVI''.<
Situation comedy is one of the areas highlighted for improvement by BBC
Governors in the last annual report.<
More new comedy in the #195 million Autumn schedule unveiled today will come
from Birds Of A Feather writers Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran in a
pre-watershed sitcom called Starting Out.<
Caroline Aherne and Craig Cash's The Royle Family graduates to BBC1 for its
second series after winning big audiences on BBC2.<
The wars of the 20th century will be marked by two dramas and a factual
series.<
David Jason, more often seen now on ITV, stars with Maggie Smith in All The
King's Men, a dramatisation of the legend surrounding the disappearance of an
entire company at Gallipoli in the First World War.<
Real-life testimony about the crucial months of 1940 in the Second World War
will feature in Finest Hour, a factual series by Brian Lapping.<
Heartthrob Ioan Gruffudd stars in Warriors, a Bosnia drama directed (correct)
by Peter Kosminsky.<
Other drama scheduled for the Autumn includes costume drama Wives And
Daughters starring Bill Paterson, Michael Gambon and Francesca Annis and Pure
Wickedness, a Lucy Gannon drama about adultery starring Kevin Whately.<
Returning for new series will be Jonathan Creek, Casualty, Holby City,
Dangerfield and Ballykissangel.<
Walking With Dinosaurs is a ground-breaking recreation of prehistoric life,
using stunning computer animation.<
Prime Minister John Major's premiership will be summed up in The Major Years.<
This year's BBC Annual Report said BBC1 needed to make itself more distinct
from commercial channels.<
BBC bosses know it must prove it is different to justify the licence fee,
especially in the light of the Gavyn Davies report on the need for new BBC
funding to support digital services.<
Controller Peter Salmon said: ``BBC1 is at the heart of the BBC's public
service commitment _ now and in the digital future _ and this schedule is
tangible proof of that.<
``What this autumn on BBC1 represents is something the commercial sector can't
or won't produce.<
``There are no rights to be bought for a king's ransom.<
``It's not about poaching stars, it's not about imitating innovative formats.<
``It is about ambition, quality, commitment and talent.''<

FLAGSHIP SERIES BANKS ON DINOSAUR APPEAL<
By Jackie Burdon, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Creatures who walked the Earth more than 65 million years ago are brought back
to life by state-of-the-art computer animation and advanced puppetry in new
television series Walking With Dinosaurs.<
Three years in the making, the stunning six part series is set to be the BBC's
landmark science programme later this year, just as The Human Body was last
year.<
``Put it this way, in all of Jurassic Park there were eight minutes of
dinosaur action footage. This is a whole series of it,'' BBC1 controller Peter
Salmon said today.<
``Dinosaurs ruled the earth for 170 million years, so that certainly puts our
millennium into perspective.''<
Thanks to informed scientific guesswork and advanced technology, favourites
like tyrannosaurus rex, diplodocus and stegosaurus will be seen in action,
hunting, feeding and breeding.<
The recreated dinosaurs are shot against backgrounds as close to the
prehistoric settings as can still be found, such as monkey puzzle forests in
Chile and New Zealand tree ferns.<
Less familiar beasts will be introduced to audiences, like the biggest ever
carnivore, liopleurodon and ornithocheirus, the largest flying creature.<
The film-makers went under water to create dramatic predator sequences
involving massive former inhabitants of the deep.<
Series producer Tim Haines said: ``Walking With Dinosaurs is the world's first
natural history of dinosaurs.<
``For the first time ever, people will have a window into a lost world to see
what it was really like when these extraordinary animals inhabited the Earth.<
``We'll show how these amazing creatures moved, how they lived and died, how
they hunted and fed, how they behaved and interacted with each other, how they
mated and brought up their young _ all set against authentic backgrounds.''<
Mr Salmon said: ``Not just children are going to love this series. I think
adults will enjoy it too.''<
A time and date for the series has yet to be announced.<

TV BOSS DEFENDS UNDER-FIRE BBC1<
By Jackie Burdon, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
BBC1 controller Peter Salmon defended his channel today in what he admitted
has been a difficult year.<
Growing commercial competition, consultation on the BBC licence fee review and
a ``could do better'' report from the BBC Governors have put BBC1 under
pressure.<
But launching his latest #195 million programme line-up, Mr Salmon said:
``This autumn's schedule will confound the Jeremiahs prophesying the imminent
demise of BBC1.''<
Spectacular science series Walking With Dinosaurs, new French and Saunders
sitcom Let Them Eat Cake and a trilogy of programmes about war throughout the
century are some of the highlights of the coming BBC1 season.<
Mr Salmon said today's launch was ``one of the most important in BBC1's
history''.<
He said: ``It comes in the teeth of fiercely aggressive and growing
competition, and at the end of a tough year before the dawn of a new millennium,
in the thick of licence fee consultation. So not much pressure there then. But I
am greatly proud of it.''<
He added: ``The end of broadcasting as we once knew it started some years ago,
and it would be disingenuous to say that this has been an easy year for BBC1.<
``We had to face some real problems, and most of them in the full glare of the
white hot media spotlight, but I think we have come out the stronger for it.''<
Former BBC1 controller Alan Yentob is presiding over a review of BBC1's
distinctiveness and public service purpose, after the BBC annual report said it
needed to make daytime schedules more distinctive and improve its comedy,
entertainment and popular drama genres.<
Mr Salmon said: ``What this autumn on BBC1 represents is something the
commercial sector can't or won't produce.<
``There are no rights to be bought for a king's ransom. It is not about
poaching stars. It is not about imitating innovative formats.<
``It's about ambition, quality, commitment and talent.''<
Mr Salmon said he worked at an ITV company before he joined the BBC.<
``I know the pressures that they are under; pressures that led to the
momentous and dubious decision to move News At Ten.<
``I am not attacking ITV. They must do what they must do. But I know what
makes us different.''<
BBC1 recently lost its sport figurehead Des Lynam to ITV, and a rash of
similar lifestyle and docusoap formats have appeared on each channel.<
The end of News At Ten made way for a new ITV evening schedule including
ratings-grabbing films and quiz Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?<
At today's BBC1 schedule launch docusoaps took a back seat as Mr Salmon
focused on landmark drama, science and factual programming.<
Pride And Prejudice adapter Andrew Davies has turned his hand to Elizabeth
Gaskell's Wives And Daughters and Clive Owen is appearing in contemporary drama
Second Sight by Paula Milne.<
Undercover is a new investigative series being kept under wraps, because its
research team is still in the field.<

Elisabeth Murdoch, managing director, Sky Networks, said: ``We are honoured to

create a selection of new characters.<
The newspaper said he was ``switching to Sky in a #1 million deal''.<
But a BBC spokeswoman said: ``He was never under exclusive contract to the
BBC, he always had other projects. He is a huge talent with a lot of different
projects and ideas, and this is one of them.<
``Harry will be continuing to work with the BBC and will be part of millennium

GRANT HOPING FOR SECOND HIT OF THE SUMMER<
By Peter Walker, PA News<
Actor Hugh Grant will be hoping for his second hit film of the summer when he
attends the premiere of Mickey Blue Eyes tonight.<
Following the runaway success of Notting Hill, Grant will unveil his new work
in London's West End this evening alongside partner Elizabeth Hurley, who
produced the film.<
Others expected to attend include Grant's Notting Hill co-star Rhys Ifans,
Oasis singer Liam Gallagher and his wife Patsy Kensit, and actress Joan
Collins.<
Mickey Blue Eyes, which has received some favourable reviews in America, is a
light-hearted comedy about an Englishman in New York who accidentally becomes
involved with the Mafia.<
Yet again, Grant plays the wide-eyed and foppish English innocent, this time
an art auctioneer.<
His character is blissfully engaged to a teacher played by US star Jean
Tripplehorn, but there is a problem _ she is the daughter of a Mafia boss.<
The film charts Grant's escapades as he gets sucked inexorably into the Mob's
world and tries to stay afloat, not to mention alive.<

HOW HOLLYWOOD TREATS THE MOB<
By Peter Walker, PA News<
The film world's favourite foppish Englishman, Hugh Grant, will be among the
stars at the premiere of his new Mafia-based comedy, Mickey Blue Eyes tonight.<
Grant plays a British auctioneer living in New York who becomes accidentally
embroiled with the Mob because his fiancee is from a Mafia family.<
The light-hearted treatment of Mafia family values is another demonstration of
how Hollywood's treatment of organised crime has changed over the decades:<
:: Most of the first gangster films, such as 1932's Scarface _ later re-made
starring Al Pacino _ treated organised crime as a violent menace to American
society.<
:: The seminal Mafia film is undoubtedly The Godfather. Francis Ford Coppola's
1972 masterpiece told the story of the Mob through the Corleone family's complex
and subtle relationships.<
:: The film and its two sequels were so influential that some real-life Mafia
families have been accused of actually cultivating the look and mannerisms
portrayed by Al Pacino and Marlon Brando.<
:: Another Italian-American director, Martin Scorcese, showed the seamier side
of the Mafia world in 1990's enormously influential Goodfellas. His gangsters
existed in a jealous, violent and often treacherous world.<
:: Five years later Scorcese delved still deeper into the troubled personal
lives of the Mafiosi in Casino. <
:: Robert De Niro's Sam Rothstein was not only the hugely successful boss of a
crooked Las Vegas casino, but an anxious husband and father married to alcoholic
Sharon Stone, who eventually betrays him with best friend Joe Pesci.<
:: In 1997, Al Pacino shed the glamour of The Godfather's Michael Corleone to
play Donnie Brasco, a forty-something Mafia foot soldier whose ``work'' is often
little more than monotonous and seedy chores.<
:: In the film Pacino is befriended by undercover FBI agent Johnny Depp - and
spends much of his time complaining about the way his bosses treat him.<
:: Humorous television series The Sopranos, currently showing on Channel 4,
portrays the boss of a New Jersey crime family as a vulnerable, anxious man
seeking help from a psychiatrist.<
:: ``Waste management consultant'' Tony Soprano has normal family problems
such as a troublesome teenage daughter and a mean-spirited aged mother. To add
to his woes, he occasionally has to kill people.<
:: The theme is repeated in comedy film Analyse This, yet to be released in
Britain. Robert De Niro sends up some of his earlier gangster roles playing a
Mafia boss unloading his troubles to an understandably worried psychiatrist.<

HURLEY'S DRESS DAZZLES PREMIERE CROWD<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Liz Hurley dazzled the crowd tonight in a daring dress covered with hundreds
of tiny mirrors as she accompanied boyfriend Hugh Grant to the premiere of his
new movie Mickey Blue Eyes.<
And the actress, who produced the film rather than starring in it, revealed
she actually manages to get ready for her glitzy appearances faster than her
long-term partner.<
Speaking at the screening in London's Leicester Square, the glamorous star
said: ``It doesn't take me long to get ready, but it takes Hugh ages.<
``He has a lot of shirts to choose from but they all look the same.''<
Hurley's dresses have been show stoppers at many of Grant's past premieres
including the opening of Four Weddings And A Funeral where she wore the Versace
safety-pin creation and the Notting Hill event at which she upstaged the star
Julia Roberts.<
Tonight she chose Versace again with a backless floor-length split dress made
of gold mesh which was sheer around the legs.<
On it was sewn a myriad of mirrors which jangled as she walked, as well as a
mosaic of tiny pink squares.<
She said of her passion for Versace: ``Donatella is a friend of mine and she
sends them to me from time to time. <
``I wear jeans 365 days a year and it's quite nice to get out of them
occasionally.''<
It is the first time that Hurley has produced one of her boyfriends movies and
Grant said it was a ``surprisingly good'' experience.<
But he added: ``We fight as you would with any girlfriend that's working with
you, like cats. But it's also quite soothing if you're a neurotic actor like I
am when there's someone who knows your foibles.''<
In the film he plays an English auctioneer who falls in love with a woman,
played by Jeanne Tripplehorn, whose father is tied up with the mafia. Gradually
Grant is drawn into the mob's world.<
He said tonight: ``I've always been obsessed with the mob. I've always wanted
to be in a mob film, and no one asked me, but now I am.''<
Tripplehorn was also at the event in a stunning outfit, this time with a black
floor-length sleeveless dress with a sheer top and only a dark band to spare her
blushes.<
Other guests at the screening included Oasis star Liam Gallagher and his
pregnant wife Patsy Kensit, for whose child Hurley is to be Godmother.<

OASIS STAR BONEHEAD QUITS<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Oasis guitarist Paul ``Bonehead'' Arthurs has quit the hugely successful rock
band after eight years.<
The 34-year-old musician announced yesterday he was leaving the group in what
was said to be an amicable split.<
In a statement Arthurs said: ``After a lot of consideration I have decided to
call it a day with Oasis.<
``I've had a fantastic eight years in one of the best bands ever to come out
of Britain, and now feel I have come to the stage where I'd like to concentrate
on other things in my life, outside of the demands of being in a successful rock
and roll band.''<
The statement, released by the band's label Creation Records, continued:
``I've made some great friends along the way and wish everyone in the band every
success with the next album, and intend to enjoy watching the band go on to
further success in the coming years.<
``I would like to thank the band and everyone around it, especially the fans,
for making it so special. See you at the next show!''<
The band's spokesman said the departure had only been decided yesterday but
Arthurs had been considering it over the weekend.<
``It's been discussed between them all,'' he said.<
Arthurs was a founder member of the band, which was originally formed as Rain
in Burnage, Manchester, in 1991 with drummer Tony McCarroll and bass player Paul
``Guigsy'' McGuigan.<
A new singer, Liam Gallagher, suggested a change of name and the appointment
of his brother Noel, a former roadie with Oldham band Inspiral Carpets, gave the
group a new direction.<
Bonehead's rhythm guitar playing was an integral part of Oasis' powerful
sound, but he kept a lower public profile than lead guitarist and songwriter
Noel Gallagher.<
There are no plans for a replacement, the band's spokesman said.<
Arthurs, a father of two who lives with his wife Kate in Bowden, Cheshire, had
completed work on the band's fourth studio album, which is still being mixed.<
His departure means that only McGuigan remains from the original line-up.<
McCarroll was sacked in 1995 and awarded a lump sum of #550,000 earlier this
year in an out of court settlement instead of royalties.<

OASIS LEADER PLAYS DOWN GUITARIST'S DEPARTURE<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Oasis star Noel Gallagher has played down the significance of guitarist Paul
``Bonehead'' Arthurs' departure by saying: ``It's hardly Paul McCartney leaving
The Beatles.''<
Speaking to music paper New Musical Express he confirmed that Arthurs had
quit, but said it happened as far back as March _ not over the weekend as the
band's publicist said.<
Band leader Gallagher said: ``Yeah, he's gone. He left in March. He wanted to
spend more time with his family.<
``He has two kids up in Manchester and he wanted to be with them so we let him
go.<
``It's hardly Paul McCartney leaving The Beatles. It happens, things happen.
He did his thing for the record but that's that _ so we have to find another
guitarist now.''<
Yesterday, the group's spokesman said Arthurs, 34, would not be replaced.<
A journalist from NME spoke to the band at London's Olympic Studios, where
they are working with producer Mark ``Spike'' Stent on mixes for the new album
due out next year.<
``We're not touring until next year so there's no rush to find a guitarist
just yet,'' Gallagher added.<
Yesterday, Arthurs _ who was in an early incarnation of the band before both
singer Liam Gallagher and lead guitarist and songwriter Noel _ issued a
statement through his label Creation Records.<
It read: ``After a lot of consideration I have decided to call it a day with
Oasis.<
``I've had a fantastic eight years in one of the best bands ever to come out
of Britain, and now feel I have come to the stage where I'd like to concentrate
on other things in my life, outside of the demands of being in a successful rock
and roll band.''<
``I've made some great friends along the way and wish everyone in the band
every success with the next album, and intend to enjoy watching the band go on
to further success in the coming years.<
Despite Gallagher's assertion that the rhythm guitarist left in March, he was
reported to have been seen in April at the French chateau in which the band were
recording.<
He did return to the UK before the rest of the band, according to the latest
edition of NME, which is published nationally tomorrow.<

ROW OVER BLACKADDER MILLENNIUM SPECIAL<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
TV's Blackadder was at the centre of a row today as rival broadcasters
disagreed about their cunning plans to screen a one-off millennium special of
the historical sitcom.<
Sky Television claimed a coup by announcing it would be the first to screen
the star-studded Rowan Atkinson film, Time For Blackadder, on TV.<
Yet although the BBC concedes it might have missed out on being first, it
brushed aside Sky claims that the Corporation will not screen it at all.<
The 30-minute film has been produced to be shown as part of millennium
celebrations and will be shown exclusively at the Dome's entertainment venue
Skyscape _ which is sponsored by Sky.<
It stars Atkinson, Tony Robinson and other well established stars of the four
Blackadder series aired first on the BBC. Indeed, the film's executive producer
is the BBC's head of comedy, Geoffrey Perkins.<
The film _ featuring Blackadder and Baldrick hurtling through history in a
time machine _ is then to be screened on TV in 2001.<
Sky said today that it had won the ``exclusive'' rights to the special, while
the BBC claimed to know nothing of a deal.<
But Dome supervisor the New Millennium Experience Company was unable to say
who would show it first.<
A NMEC spokesman said: ``We are currently in discussions with both Sky and the
BBC as to the broadcasting of the film after the exhibition closes.''<
However a Sky publicist said: ``We have a deal. We have agreed terms. The BBC
are obviously having trouble coming to terms with their loss.''<
A BBC spokeswoman said it was probably the case that Sky might be first to
broadcast the special, but said: ``There is absolutely no question of this not
being shown on the BBC.<
``It is certainly not the case that we have lost Blackadder. This is a
one-off, stand-alone film which we agreed would be shown at a national monument
and would then be on the BBC.<

TOP STARS LINED UP FOR INTERNET CONCERTS<
By Jackie Burdon, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
George Michael, Robbie Williams, Celine Dion and The Corrs are among top pop
acts set to highlight world poverty at concerts to be linked by a massive
Internet broadcast in October.<
They are among the first artists named for the three linked concerts in
London, New York and Geneva which organisers hope will inspire music fans as
much as the Live Aid concerts for Ethiopia 15 years ago.<
``The concerts will be one of the most widely broadcast programmes for social
change in history,'' a spokesman said today.<
As well as being broadcast from one of the world's most powerful web sites,
NetAid on October 9 will be shown by the BBC in Britain and other television
channels around the world.<
The concert is being organised by the United Nations Development Programme and
leading Internet company Cisco Systems.<
Proceeds from the three concerts will go to help Kosovo refugees and African
countries, and a NetAid Foundation is being set up to channel funds long-term.<
Other artists already signed up are Jimmy Page, Pete Townshend, Counting
Crows, Eurythmics, Jewel, Wyclef Jean, Bono and Michael Kamen and Orchestra.<

The only way to see the concerts live will be at the NetAid site - the
television broadcasts will be highlights shown no earlier than the next day.<
A distribution network of more than 1,500 servers worldwide is being set up
which will be able to handle 125,000 live streams, 10 times more than any
previous single site.<
KPMG, Akamai Technologies and Real Networks are playing their part in setting
up the site and broadcast.<
Net surfers will be able to donate money through the site, but organisers'
main intention is to highlight extreme poverty and bring concerned people
together to fight it.<
It will eventually be linked to the sites of dozens of non-governmental
organisations tackling world poverty.<
UNDP administrator Mark Malloch Brown said: ``An estimated 1.3 billion people
in the world live on less than a dollar a day.<
``The gulf between the world's rich and poor is growing.<
``But a group of very reasonable policy makers have concluded that it is a
reasonable target to set that by the end of 2010 we can halve the number of
people living in absolute poverty.''<
On advice from the UNDP, NetAid will focus on five pillars - Third World debt,
hunger, refugees, human rights and the environment as it affects people.<
Promoter Harvey Goldsmith said: ``It is a fantastic line-up of artists and all
of them are committed to our cause of eradicating extreme poverty.<
``Bono has done a huge amount on fighting Third World debt, Eurythmics have
been very active over human rights, Robbie Williams is a United Nations
ambassador on children's issues and George Michael is concerned about
refugees.''<
To be launched on September 8, www.netaid.org will be a permanent site
dedicated to highlighting extreme poverty, and organisers hope it will register
one billion hits.<
About 55 million people use the Internet regularly, and organisers believe it
is an achievable target over time.<
Mr Goldsmith, one of Live Aid's organisers in 1985, said: ``The original
target was #1 million, and the night before Bob Geldof spoke to me and we
thought we might raise #5 million.<
``We actually raised #140 million. That was how much we moved people with Live
Aid and I think we can move people again with NetAid,'' he said.<
``There will be a backstage area were artists will be able to talk online with
people, and once they hear their passion I think people will want to help as
well.''<
The full Wembley line-up will be announced on Monday August 23, and tickets go
on sale the day after.<
A total of 110,000 tickets will be available for that concert and the one at
the Giants Stadium in New Jersey which will follow.<
The Geneva event will be shorter and by invitation only.<
Cisco Systems UK managing director Chris Dedicoat said he realised the
Internet revolution was leaving most of the world's poorest people behind.<
``The potential of NetAid is to harness the resources of the Internet to help
impoverished people to set up an infrastructure so that it is easier for the
developed world to help,'' he said.<

RAVI SET TO LEAVE THE STREET<
By Sinead McIntyre, PA News<
Shopkeeper Ravi Desai is to be written out of Coronation Street.<
Actor Saeed Jaffrey was brought in to reflect the reality of multi-cultural
Britain, but he will now be written out, and Coronation Street bosses are
currently casting for a new male Desai family member to play the part of a
cousin.<
A spokeswoman for the show said the decision was nothing to do with the
actor's arrest last month after an incident on a Euston to Manchester train.<
She said: ``It is nothing to do with that incident on the train. The decision
was taken before that. I think people are reading things into this that aren't
there.''<
``People are written out, and it is not necessarily for ever. The Desai family
are an important part of the Street and we are casting for a new member.''<
The spokeswoman said that Ravi would be written out in a definite way.<
She said: ``He will leave Weatherfield for a reason, although we can't divulge
why. He won't just go up the stairs and never come down again, but be talked
about as if he is still there.''<
``And he won't be leaving any broken hearts behind'', she added.<

MY EX-MANAGER DOES NOT EXIST _ SIR ELTON<
By Jackie Burdon, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Sir Elton John feels ``partly to blame'' for the rift with his long-standing
manager John Reid, but thinks he will never speak to him again, he has said.<
``As far as I'm concerned, he doesn't exist any more, which is very sad, but
he doesn't,'' he told Sir David Frost in a wide-ranging interview to be shown in
America this weekend.<
Sir Elton dispensed with Reid's management services last year after a business
relationship of 28 years, and Reid has reportedly paid the star a multi-million
settlement out of court.<
Legal discussion continues over more allegedly missing millions with Andrew
Haydon, former managing director of John Reid Enterprises and accountants Price
Waterhouse Coopers.<
John Reid was Sir Elton's first boyfriend in the singer-songwriter's early
years of success in the 1970s.<
In the Frost interview, to be screened on American cable channel A&E on Sunday
night, Sir Elton said: ``I was partly to blame for this whole thing I suppose,
with John Reid, because I never audited it in 28 years, and when I did it was a
shock.<
``He was my first relationship and there was that element of trust, which is
so necessary to have.''<
``Saddened'' John Reid has said Sir Elton's claims ``have no foundation in
fact.''<
Sir Elton also spoke of his problems following the takeover of his worldwide
record company Polygram by Universal.<
``It's an absolute disaster.  I think when one company buys another, for the
first two years it's more or less chaos and mayhem,'' he said.<
One To One With David Frost: Elton John: My Gift Is My Song was recorded in
Britain before Sir Elton's heart health scare and pacemaker operation.<
His rescheduled British concerts are now taking place next month.<
Sir Elton, 52, talked candidly about his former drug problems.<
``Clinically, I should be dead,'' he said, but added: ``I have the
constitution of an ox.''<
His notorious throat problems midway through an Australian tour in the
mid-1980s were caused by marijuana, he revealed.<
``I couldn't really talk, I could just about sing,'' he said.<
``I went to a specialist in Sydney and I walked in and said: `Good morning.'<
``The first thing he said was: `You smoke marijuana.'  I was so shocked.<
``And he said: `I can tell you that's not good for your voice.'''<
Sir Elton was terrified he had cancer: ``That big word, you know, the
six-letter one that fills you with fear.''<
Once the tour was over he had two benign growths removed from his throat and
he never smoked marijuana again, although he was still taking drugs including
cocaine.<
``I didn't give up the hokey-cokey, as they say, but the marijuana went
straight out of the window,'' he said.<
Drug-free since 1990, Sir Elton revealed he cleaned up in hospital: ``Because
I have my doubts about some of these rehab centres.<
``I just think some of these places now are not strict enough.''<
Treatment only lasts four weeks and clients have televisions in their rooms,
but he had to clean up after himself and do his own washing, he said.<
Sir Elton hit out at the ``wailing and caterwauling'' from Madonna and other
celebrities about press intrusion after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.<
``They've manipulated the press to suit their own ends.<
``What they go through and what I go through is nothing to what she went
through.''<

PLAQUE MARKS CENTENARY OF MASTER OF TERROR'S BIRTH<
By Rebecca Allison, PA News<
The daughter of the undisputed master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, was today
marking the centenary of his birth at a special ceremony.<
Patricia Hitchcock O'Connell was to revisit the London flat, home to her
famous father and mother for more than a decade, and unveil a commemorative
plaque.<
The English Heritage blue plaque marking his birthday, which aptly fell on
Friday 13, honoured his unique contribution to the world of cinema.<
The director and his wife Alma Reville lived in the upstairs flat on the
Cromwell Road for 13 years during his early career as he was making a name for
himself at the Islington Studios.<
The couple, and their 10-year-old daughter later moved to the US in 1939,
where his career took off and he became one of the biggest film legends in
Hollywood.<
His thrillers, including Psycho and The Birds, have inspired terror in
generations of filmgoers and are regarded as classics worldwide.<
During his long career he directed an illustrious list of screen greats which
included Cary Grant in North By North West, and James Stewart and Grace Kelly in
Rear Window.<
Hitchcock, born on August 13, 1899, to a Catholic family in Leytonstone, was
well known for his cameo appearances in his films.<
Fans would eagerly await the fleeting moment when he would appear in the
background in some form, often as an inconspicuous passer-by.<
Patricia too made appearances in her father's films, including Stagefright and
Psycho, which was recently voted his best film by a distinguished panel of
directors.<
Today she also was also to make an appearance in advance of a special auction
of posters at Christie's in London as part of the centenary celebrations for her
father, who died in 1980.<
More than 100 film posters spanning his illustrious career will go under the
hammer on Monday September 13.<

LIFE AND TIMES OF ALFRED HITCHCOCK<
By Rebecca Allison, PA News<
The daughter of the undisputed master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, wastoday
marking the centenary of his birth at a special ceremony.<
:: Hitchcock began his career in advertising. He entered the film industry in
1920, designing subtitles and his talent was spotted.<
:: He met his wife Alma Reville when he was an engineering student at London
University and she was a film editor at the fledgling Paramount studios. The
couple, who were married for 54 years had a daughter, Patricia.<
:: He was a close friend and confidant of many of Hollywood's most glamorous
women including Grace Kelly, Ingrid Bergman, Tippi Hedren and Kim Novak.<
:: The director, who died in 1980, has in the past been accused of exploiting
his stars by manipulating their emotions and was once quoted as calling actors
``cattle''.<
:: A famous example of his alleged insensitivity towards stars involved Tippi
Hedren in The Birds when, legend has it, she did not know so many real birds
would be used and was traumatised for months afterwards by the terrifying
scene.<
:: Filming the famous shower scene in the 1960 film Psycho took seven working
days and more than 70 takes for just 45 seconds of film.<
:: Janet Leigh, who played the murder victim Marion Crane recently said she
had never got over the shock of seeing Psycho for the first time and has never
taken a shower again.<
:: Hitchcock bought the rights to the novel on which the film was based
anonymously from Robert Bloch for 9,000. He then bought as many copies as he
could, to keep the ending a secret.<
:: Sharp-eyed fans would look forward to his renowned cameo appearances in the
background of nearly all his films, for example his role as clockwinder in Rear
Window, and numerous appearances as a passer-by.<
:: The British Film Institute is holding a programme of Hitchcock centenary
events.<

MEL C CHOOSES CLUB FOR FIRST SOLO APPEARANCE<
By Mark Wilkinson, PA News<
Spice Girl Mel C has chosen a small club to play her first ever solo concert,
it was disclosed today.<
Sporty Spice has chosen The Leadmill, Sheffield, which has a capacity of just
900, for her debut gig on Thursday.<
A spokesman for the club said: ``It should be a really exciting night. We're
expecting a full house and we're delighted she has chosen us for her first
concert.''<
Mel C last appeared in Sheffield in September 1998, when the Spice Girls
played two 40,000 sell-out shows at the Don Valley Stadium.<
``The crowd is obviously going to be a lot smaller, but we're hoping for a
good atmosphere,'' said the spokesman.<
``She chose us because she wanted a nice intimate venue with a bit of history
before she appears at the V99 Festival.''<
The club has played host to Oasis, Pulp and Paul Weller in the past, but more
recent artists have included the likes of Sneaker Pimps and reggae artist
Mishka.<
``The other Mel has gone off and done solo stuff, now it is my turn to have a
bit of a scream and shout,'' said Mel. ``The band and the set I am doing is very
appropriate for the venue.''<
Mel plays her first big solo concerts at the V99 Festivals in Chelmsford and
Staffordshire on August 21 and 22, prior to the release of her debut solo
single, called Goin' Down, on September 27.<

DRINK-DRIVING BAN COSTS COOGAN `DREAM JOB'<
By Jackie Burdon, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Top Gear presenter Brendan Coogan has lost his dream job because of a
drink-drive conviction, it emerged today.<
Coogan, 28, pleaded guilty on Monday to driving with excess alcohol in his
blood. He had been stopped by police the morning after a drinking session.<
Coogan, the brother of comedian Steve, said he hoped his misfortune would
highlight the perils of getting behind the wheel the day after drinking.<
He said: ``I would urge anyone who knows that they have to drive the next day
to think very carefully about how much they drink the previous evening.<
``I would consider myself very unlucky. I have lost my dream job because of
this mistake.''<
Brendan was one of the new presenters who joined BBC2 motoring programme Top
Gear after the departure of Jeremy Clarkson.<
He pleaded guilty to drink-driving at Huddersfield Magistrates Court on
Monday.<
A BBC spokeswoman said: ``He has received a ban of 12 months and a fine of
#500.<
``Brendan was not alert to the dangers of the morning after drinking, and is
absolutely horrified that this has happened.<
``He's keen to use this opportunity of his profile to make members of the
public aware of them.''<
Coogan added: ``I am quite philosophical. I would never knowingly drink and
drive - I think drinking and driving is morally reprehensible and here I am
convicted of the very same. I find it very embarrassing.''<
The offence happened after he spent an evening drinking with his girlfriend
and other friends.<
He got a taxi home, slept from 1.30am to 11am and then drove off in his car to
see his team Manchester United play Middlesbrough.<
``On his way he was stopped by West Yorkshire Police and breathalysed, and he
was subsequently charged on Monday June 14,'' the BBC spokeswoman said.<
A blood test confirmed he was slightly over the limit, she said.<
Coogan once crashed his brother's Ferrari, but he declared himself in favour
of careful and polite driving.<
The BBC spokeswoman said: ``Brendan was an ad hoc contributor employed on a
programme-by-programme basis for BBC2's Top Gear.''<
The loss of his driving licence meant he would not be taken back on for the
next series which returns in the autumn, she said.<
``Top Gear will review this situation once the ban has been lifted.''<

Coogan said today that he believed his record would bar him from ever working
for a motoring show again.<
``I resigned. I walked away because I did not want to embarrass them. It's
unlikely I will ever apply to Top Gear again because of the conviction.<
``Gutted is an often-used phrase, but it does not do justice to how I feel.<
``I am devastated. I am a reasonably young lad in a profession that is quite
precarious, and I had landed my dream job. I am nuts about cars and there I was
contributing to Top Gear,'' he said.<
``To have that all taken away from me for what was a stupid mistake _ I was
really down and upset about it, but I am starting to come to terms with it now.<
``I'm not asking people to feel sorry for me because plenty of other people
have lost their jobs in the same position.<
``I still have other television and radio presenting jobs, but Top Gear is a
programme everybody knows and likes.<
``It was my top gig.''<
He added: ``Yes, I had been out with friends, but it was not an especially big
night.<
``If I had thought for a second that I was over the limit, I would never have
got behind the wheel.<
``My driving was impaired, and I have to acknowledge that.<
``I would like to warn people of the dangers, because it is astonishing just
how long after the night before you can be over the limit.''<

COMPO TO HAVE POIGNANT `SUMMER WINE' SEND-OFF<
By Jackie Burdon, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
A poignant demise for Compo is to be written into new scripts for Last Of The
Summer Wine, the BBC confirmed today, following the death of actor Bill Owen,
who played the much-loved character for 26 years.<
The coming series was midway through filming when Mr Owen died, aged 85,
earlier this week.<
A BBC spokeswoman said: ``It is early days, but I think that the general
feeling is that Compo was such an important and integral character that it is
inevitable he could not be written out in any other way.''<
Preparing to re-write the remaining episodes, writer Roy Clarke said the
poignant death of the pensioner would be written into the new scripts.<
``There is no way we can pretend that Compo has just gone away: that would be
an insult to the man and his fans,'' he told the Daily Express.<
``I believe we must portray his death in the script. It may prove too
difficult for his family, but it would be a tribute to the actor and his
audience to make an honest attempt to give Compo a decent burial.''<
Before his final illness, Bill Owen revealed that he planned to be laid to
rest in Holmfirth, the Yorkshire setting of the series which is the
longest-running sitcom on British television.<
In scenes already filmed Compo finally wins a kiss from the fearsome Nora
Batty after 26 years of tireless pursuit.<
Kathy Staff, who plays the battle-axe with the wrinkly stockings, said Mr Owen
asked producers to grant Compo's lifetime wish knowing he was ill.<
A BBC entertainment spokeswoman said it was far too early to decide whether Mr
Owen's death would end Last Of The Summer Wine for good.<
``I don't think anybody is able to say at this stage,'' she said.<

SUMMER WINE `CAN GO ON WITHOUT COMPO'<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Last Of The Summer Wine star Peter Sallis said the long-running show should
live on, despite the death this week of well-loved actor Bill Owen, who played
loveable scruff Compo.<
Sallis, who plays Clegg, disagreed with co-star Kathy Staff, who suggested the
series should fold without Compo, who constantly fought for the affections of
her character, Nora Batty, in the show.<
Owen himself - who died on Monday after a cancer battle - would have wanted
the gentle comedy to continue, Sallis told London station LBC 1152AM.<
``I think that Kathy is wrong. I do agree with her that Bill is irreplaceable
and that not having him there, it's not going to seem the same,'' he said.<
``But I have an idea that there is sufficient to watch in that programme with
the others.<
``It's a very, very strong team and although one part of me agrees with Kathy,
the other part says I think (writer) Roy Clarke and the BBC have, if they want
to continue with it, the means to do so.<
``I don't think for a moment Bill would have thought `Oh well, I've gone so we
better close the programme'. Really, basically, he would have wished it to go
on.''<
Clarke has already indicated that he will be writing Compo's death into the
scripts, which are now being revised. Three episodes of a new series have
already been filmed with Owen.<
In those last scenes Compo finally wins a kiss from Nora Batty after 26 years
of tireless pursuit.<
Owen had asked producers to grant Compo's lifetime wish knowing he was ill.<
A BBC entertainment spokeswoman said today that it was far too early to decide
whether Mr Owen's death would end Last Of The Summer Wine for good.<
``I don't think anybody is able to say at this stage,'' she said.<

CHARLES JOINS STARS GALORE TO SEE PHANTOM MENACE<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
The Prince of Wales joins a galaxy of stars tonight when he becomes one of the
first people in the UK to see the eagerly-awaited Star Wars prequel at the Royal
Premiere in London.<
Just hours later, hundreds of thousands of fans will besiege screens as
Episode I - The Phantom Menace opens at upwards of 370 cinemas around the UK and
Ireland.<
Charles will meet actors like Ewan McGregor and Samuel L Jackson, as well as
director George Lucas when the film blasts off at the Odeon in Leicester
Square.<
Having already taken a colossal 385 million dollars (#240 million) in eight
weeks of release in the US alone, the film is on target to become the biggest
grossing film of all time.<
It takes cinemagoers back 30 years from the original blockbuster to show the
early years of Anakin Skywalker _ who went on to terrorise the universe as Darth
Vader in the trio of Star Wars movies which are already familiar to fans.<
Thousands are expected to gather in Leicester Square to watch guests troop
into the cinema, which also hosted the premiere of the first Star Wars two
decades ago.<
The movie's stars _ including Natalie Portman (Princess Amidala) and Anthony
Daniels (C-3PO) _ will be led on foot past the cheering crowds.<
Charles is not expected to take his sons Prince William and Harry to the
event, which will raise money for the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund.<
The film opens to the general public tomorrow. Eager fans swamped phone
booking lines and queued throughout the night to get their hands on tickets when
they went on sale earlier this month.<
Many cinema chains had hoped to open in the early hours to show the film, but
were unable to get clearance. Instead many will be opening from 9am and will be
showing the film back-to-back.<
Some have devoted three or four screens to the film to allow a rolling
programme of The Phantom Menace, with the movie starting every hour.<
Critics have not been universally won over by the special effects-laden film,
but the occasional poor review has not dimmed the loyalty and curiosity of fans
who have poured in to see it in the US.<
Huge interest in the space saga was demonstrated this week when the first Star
Wars was named the best movie of all time in a poll for the Sky Premier
channel.<

SPACE EPIC FANS FLOCK TO SEE THE STARS<

Fans were out in force tonight and fighting their own space battles as they
jostled outside the Royal Premiere of the eagerly-awaited movie Star Wars:
Episode I _ The Phantom Menace.<
A crowd of thousands stood outside the Odeon Leicester Square hoping to catch
a glimpse of the movie stars as they turned up for the screening, being attended
by the Prince of Wales.<
The London cinema, which also hosted the premiere of the original Star Wars,
was decorated with an enormous picture of new arch-villain Darth Maul.<
Fans were 10-deep in specially-built crowd cages and roared for the early
arrivals.<
They included veterans of the first three films in the saga, Peter Mayhew -
who played Chewbacca - and diminutive Kenny Baker, R2-D2.<
Baker, who also appears in the new film - which has taken 385 million dollars
(#240 million) in the US so far, told of the heat generated in his metal shell.<
``It was incredibly hot in my costume. At one point they tried to fry an egg
on the outside,'' he said.<

Brian Blessed, who plays Boss Nass, said the film appealed to the child in him.<
``I've never grown up. I just grew down,'' he said.<
``To be here and see it and to see the whole thing is great. I've only seen my
bit so far.''<
He described being cast in the film as ``a dream come true''.<
``I believe I have the last line in the film _ that's great. At last, success
at 62.''<
Ahmed Best, who plays Jar Jar Binks, said he had no problems portraying his
hyperactive character. ``Oh, I dug deep,'' he joked. ``I'm naturally a very
energetic kind of person.<
``This is the sixth time I've seen it. I've been to five others but I think
it's great every time.''<
The film has been criticised in some parts for racial stereotyping in some of
the characters, including his own.<
But he hit back, saying: ``If you see racism in an animated,
computer-generated character then you have a problem.''<
Writer and director George Lucas, who personally financed the blockbuster, was
also at tonight's screening.<
He said: ``It's great to be here because most of the crew are here and
everyone else who helped to make it.''<
He brushed off some of the poor reviews of the film, saying: ``None of my
films have been received well. People forget these films are aimed at children
not at adults.''<
Actress Natalie Portman received some of the biggest cheers of the night on
her arrival, wearing a strapless duck egg blue bodice and a chiffon skirt of the
same shade and her hair plaited and tucked up at the back.<
She said: ``It's fantastic being here because we never get that much attention
in the United States because there are so many films.<
``It was really exciting making the film. It was a big action film and it was
exciting to do but you had to imagine a lot, standing in front of a blue
screen.''<
However, the biggest roar from the crowd came when Samuel L Jackson walked
along the boulevard in front of the cinema, wearing a white dinner jacket and
his trademark Kangol hat pulled round the wrong way.<
Jackson, who plays Jedi knight Mace Windu, said: ``The best memory I have was
showing up on the first day and putting on my Jedi outfit knowing it was
mine.''<
Ewan McGregor, who plays young Obi-Wan Kenobi, had to be hurried into the
cinema because of the arrival of the Prince of Wales at the premiere but managed
to say: ``It was great being a Jedi _ real Boys Own stuff.''<
Among the guests were Film 99 host Jonathan Ross with his wife Jane Goldman,
who was wearing a red dress with lace sleeves, Ronan Keating and his wife
Yvonne, and actresses Angela Griffin and Lisa Faulkner from BBC1's Holby City.<

Stars from the pop world at the premiere included Billie, Texas singer Sharleen
Spiteri, Queen guitarist Brian May and 13-year-old singing star Charlotte
Church.<
Also at the event was newsreader Trevor McDonald, who got a bigger cheer than
actor Denis Lawson, McGregor's uncle who starred in the early Star Wars films
but was barely recognised by the crowd. <
To the bemusement of fans, a lookalike of Natalie Portman's character, Queen
Amidala, appeared on the balcony overlooking Leicester Square and silently
surveyed the scene.<
The Phantom Menace is a prequel to the three other Star Wars films and goes
back to the beginning of the story 30 years before the first space swashbuckler
was set.<

The prince shook hands and chatted with stars from the film including McGregor,
Miss Portman and child star Jake Lloyd, who lined up to meet him inside the
cinema. <
Miss Portman said afterwards that the prince had asked her whether she had
acted in a Star Wars film before and if she had enjoyed working with Lucas.<
She said: ``I told him I wasn't born when the first Star Wars film was made
and that George was very easy to work with.''<
The prince also met Samuel L Jackson, Pernilla August, who plays Shmi
Skywalker and Ahmed Best.<
The royal film performance raised #225,000 for the Cinema and Television
Benevolent Fund.<
A spokeswoman for the prince said it was the largest total to be raised at any
Royal premiere in aid of the charity, of which the Queen is patron.<
She said in recent years the Queen and Charles took it in turns to attend

FONDA AND BALDWIN ON TRACK FOR THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE FILM<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Easy Rider star Peter Fonda and movie heart-throb Alec Baldwin are on track to
star in a big screen version of Thomas The Tank Engine, it was announced today.<
Thomas & The Magic Railroad will mix many of the traditional characters
created by the Rev Wilbert Awdry with elements introduced by the film's director
Britt Allcroft, who created the animated TV series.<
Shot in the Isle Of Man, Canada and the United States, it will feature live
action footage and model animation, and is expected to released next summer.<
Baldwin, who is already well-known to Thomas fans in the US where he narrates
the series, will play the role of the magical Mr Conductor.<
And Fonda, who was Oscar nominated for Ulee's Gold, will play the new
character of Grandpa Burnett Stone, who has a central role in the story.<
In the movie his 11-year-old screen granddaughter Lily, played by Mara Wilson
from Matilda and Mrs Doubtfire, sets off to find him but gets on the wrong train
and is plunged into a battle of good against evil.<
It is set in the fantasy world of Mr Conductor's Universe with the island of
Sodor - where the talking trains live - at one end and Shining Time, nestled
deep in the heart of Indian Valley, at the other. They are connected by the
magic railroad.<
The rest of the cast, including Thomas and the rest of the trains, have not
yet been cast. The Fat Controller, Sir Topham Hat, is expected to be seen in
just an animated form.<
Many of the characters will inevitably have American accents.<
Allcroft, who is also the producer and writer of the film, was chuffed with
the casting.<
``I am delighted that Alec, Peter and Mara will bring these special characters
to life in our first Thomas feature film.<
``Having had the pleasure of working with Alec before I am excited at what he
will bring to the prime role of Mr Conductor. Regarding Peter he is a fine actor
and it is wonderful that he has decided to bring one of the central characters
to the screen.<
``As for Mara I know she is going to bring tremendous intelligence and insight
to the role of Lily.<
Production begins in the Isle Of Man next month, moving later to Toronto and
Pennsylvania.<
The late Rev Awdry first published his characters in 1945 after inventing them
to amuse his son Christopher who had measles. Christopher later took over the
authorship.<
The film has been in the sidings since 1996 when the project was first
announced. Allcroft, who already had the licence to make the TV shows, signed a
deal for rights to the name last year.<

WESTLIFE EDGE AHEAD IN RACE FOR CHRISTMAS NO 1<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Irish band Westlife has nudged ahead in the race for the Christmas chart
number one - and could topple Sir Cliff Richard this weekend.<
The group were around 3,000 sales ahead of Sir Cliff's The Millennium Prayer -
which has clung to the position for three weeks - at close of tills yesterday.<
Westlife became the first boy band to go straight to the top of the charts
with their first three singles this year.<
If their double A-side single of cover versions I Have A Dream/Seasons In The
Sun stays at the top of the chart by Sunday they will become only the second act
ever to go to number one with their first four singles in the week they were
released.<
The only other group to do so were fellow Irish stars B*Witched.<
John Lennon's enduring classic Imagine is at number three, according to the
early sales figures, 4,000 copies behind Sir Cliff.<
The single, which topped the charts shortly after he died 19 years ago this
week, was re-released due to public demand.<
Sir Cliff has the advantage of an extra day's sales built into his total
compared to his rivals as his Sunday sales count towards next week's chart.
Lennon and Westlife both had their singles released on Monday.<
The much-hyped novelty single by The Cuban Boys, featuring yodelling hamsters
from a popular web site, is in fourth place with around 20,000 sales.<
Chart expert Jason Legg of HMV said: ``It is really too close to call at this
stage. Westlife are only 3,000 ahead after selling around 40,000 copies but
anything could happen.<
``They have a strong fan base who tend to buy their records on the first day,
but they are a pop act which tends to sell well at the weekend as well.<
``Imagine is the sort of record that we would probably see selling well all
week. It could go anyway but my money would be on Westlife.''<
An all-star charity cover version of the Rolling Stones' It's Only Rock 'n'
Roll is way down at number 18 according to first day sales.<
It features the Spice Girls, who have topped the charts for the past three
Christmases, but were too busy to record a single in their own right this year.<
If Sir Cliff does hang on at the top of the charts this weekend it will be his
third Christmas number one.<
His others were Mistletoe And Wine and Saviour's Day.<

GLOBAL AUDIENCE FOR McCARTNEY'S CAVERN GIG<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Sir Paul McCartney tonight rounds off the century by playing his smallest show
for three decades, at the intimate venue which helped to propel him to stardom.<
For the first time in 36 years he will plug in his bass and perform at
Liverpool's Cavern Club where he and The Beatles set out on the path to becoming
legends.<
Although an audience of just 300 will be inside the rebuilt club, millions
around the globe will see and hear it via a webcast, TV screenings and radio
broadcasts.<
He said: ``Before The Beatles ever got big we started out playing rock'n'roll
at The Cavern.<
``I'm going back as a nod to the music that has always _ and will ever _
thrill me. I can't think of a better way to rock out the end of the century.''<
The star will be performing with the band which featured on his recent album
Run Devil Run including Pink Floyd's Dave Gilmour, Deep Purple's Ian Paice and
Mick Green of The Pirates. A few ``surprises'' are also planned.<
The Beatles performed regularly at The Cavern before they won their first
recording deal and continued to perform there until Beatlemania began to take
hold.<
Director of The Cavern, Bill Heckle, said: ``Rock 'n'roll history will be made
tonight in Liverpool. It will be loud, hot and sweaty _ just the way rock'n'roll
should be.<
``In size, the show is tiny _ but its mark will be made all around the
planet.''<
Music fans from around the world have tried to get hold of tickets for the
show but just 75 pairs were available and handed out through a raffle.<
Application forms were handed out on a first-come, first-served basis at HMV
stores and names of the lucky winners were drawn from a hat on Friday.<
TV and newspaper reporters are flying in from 20 countries to attend the
concert.<

McCARTNEY RETURNS TO THE BEATLES' SECOND HOME<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Music legend Sir Paul McCartney was returning to his roots tonight by playing
the underground venue at which The Beatles honed their skills and became almost
their second home.<
He is to play a one-off show at The Cavern Club in Liverpool for a handful of
fans.<
:: Sir Paul first played The Cavern on January 24, 1958 with The Quarrymen,
the skiffle band he saw at a Liverpool church fete and later joined after
impressing the singer, John Lennon, with his knowledge of song lyrics.<
:: He had missed the band's first Cavern show five months earlier. Instead, he
was at a scout camp in Hathersage, Derbyshire.<
:: Evolving into The Beatles, the group first played the venue under that name
at a lunchtime show on February 9, 1961. The fee was just #5 and Pete Best was
still the drummer, later replaced by Ringo Starr.<
:: Brian Epstein, the manager whose persistence led to a major record deal,
first came across the band at The Cavern. Folklore says he was alerted after an
inquiry in his record shop about one of their German recordings.<
:: His final Beatles show at The Cavern was on August 3, 1963, the group's
274th show there in two and a half years.<
:: Since then McCartney has performed 587 live concerts _ with The Beatles
(252), Wings (142) and as an artist in his own right (193).<
:: Sir Paul's performance tonight comes 12,953 days since he last performed
there.<
:: The Cavern opened in 1957 and has played host to acts like The Rolling
Stones, The Who, Queen and Elton John. Guitarist Mick Green _ who now plays in
Sir Paul's band _ appeared 11 times with Johnny Kidd And The Pirates.<
:: In 1973 The Cavern was filled in and the section above ground was
bulldozed. A new Cavern was set up nearby with little success, but in 1982 the
original venue was dug out and enlarged as a lasting tribute to The Beatles.<

INTERNET BROADCASTS McCARTNEY GIG TO MILLIONS<
By Damien Pearse, PA News<
Rock legend Sir Paul McCartney tonight kicked off his concert at the small
Liverpool venue where he made his name, in front of one of the biggest audiences
of his life - thanks to the Internet.<
A capacity crowd of just 300 people packed The Cavern Club where McCartney
played with Lennon and Co for a lunchtime audience in 1961 for a fee of just
#5.<
But millions of others from across the globe were able to see the rock 'n'
roll show on the Internet.<
The concert was so popular that many people had trouble logging on to the
Internet sites because it was too congested.<
Viewers who were able to access the site could see and hear the former Beatles
legend and his band performing completely live with pictures transmitted into
cyberspace from web cameras at the venue.<
But UK internet servers were so congested that some could only connect to the
concert through a United States link.<

CAVERN CLUB SIR PAUL ROCKS BACK THE CLOCK<
By Anthony Barnes, PA News Showbusiness Correspondent<
Music legend Sir Paul McCartney turned the clock back nearly four decades
tonight by playing in Liverpool's cramped Cavern Club _ only yards from the
original small sweaty venue where he was once an aspiring pop wannabe.<
To make the magic complete he performed one of the Beatles' songs he first
performed in the early 1960s _ I Saw Her Standing There _ as he returned to
Liverpool's Cavern Club.<
Just 300 lucky fans and guests had the privilege of seeing the 13-song
performance which lasted a little over 40 minutes. <
``Welcome to the Cavern _ it's been a long time coming, it's great to be
back,'' the multi-millionaire star announced after the ear splitting opening
song Honey Hush.<
However even Sir Paul pointed out that it was not quite the same place, which
he last played in 1963. <
``You know this isn't exactly where the Cavern was.<
``It's over there somewhere, buried under that heap of rubble,'' he said,
gesturing towards the back of the underground, low ceiling room.<
``Another brilliant city council decision. `I know, let's fill in the Cavern,
that's a good idea.' Never mind,'' Sir Paul said of the demise of the former
venue where it all began.<
Sir Paul's set was made up mainly of the rock-`n'-roll standards of his recent
back-to-basics album Run Devil Run.<
And they included the Ricky Nelson song Lonesome Town, of which both he and
his late wife Linda were huge fans in their teens.<
``This is dedicated to loved ones past, present and future,'' he said as he
introduced it.<

THOUSANDS PACK PARK TO WATCH MACCA'S RETURN<
By Mark Benattar, PA News<
Thousands of fans braved freezing weather to watch a live big screen relay of
Sir Paul McCartney's return to the Cavern Club tonight.<
The former Beatle jetted into Liverpool today to play the Mathew Street venue
which made him famous.<
Sir Paul took to the Cavern stage at 8pm to entertain the lucky few while
thousands of others watched the performance beamed from the club to a 20ft
screen at the nearby Chavaffe Park.<
Fan Pat Oakes, who worked at the Cavern Club in its heyday, watched the
spectacle with her nine-year-old granddaughter Charlotte who had travelled from
London.<
Charlotte said: ``I'm visiting my nanny and granddad so I could come to see
Paul McCartney play.<
``My mum and my granny both love the Beatles but my favourite is the
Backstreet Boys. But I think Paul McCartney's really good.''<
Pat added: ``When they were first on in the Cavern when I used to work there
they weren't that big. It wasn't until they went to Germany they became huge.<
``It's great to see him back here. It's just a shame they all split up and it
would be lovely to see the remaining Beatles back together. It would have been
really nice tonight.''<

IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK, SAYS McCARTNEY<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Rock legend Sir Paul McCartney tonight returned to the Liverpool venue where
he made his name and said: ``It's fantastic to be back at The Cavern.''<
The former Beatles star was speaking prior to his show at the tiny
subterranean club, his first there for 36 years.<
Sir Paul first played the Cavern with Lennon and Co for a lunchtime audience
in 1961 for a fee of just #5.<
Now one of the biggest names in the music world he has returned to his roots
for the concert.<
He said tonight: ``This is where it all began and for me this is where the
century is going to end when we play rock 'n' roll.<
``Remember the Beatles, before the Beatles, was a fabulous rock 'n' roll band.
That was what held us together for so long and made us so good, I think - he
said modestly,'' the musician joked.<
``I'm back here because I love Liverpool and there's no better place to rock
out the century.''<
Sir Paul has kept the contents of the show closely under wraps but it is bound
to feature a string of rock 'n' roll anthems.<
He said: ``I've come back because I've done a rock 'n' roll album called Run
Devil Run and I want to plug it.''<
Just 300 people will witness the performance in the venue. However up to
15,000 will be able to see it on a giant video screen in Liverpool's Chavasse
Park and a global audience of millions will be able to see it on the Internet.<
Fans flocked round the entrance to the Cavern Club this evening to catch a
glimpse of their hero, but tight security meant that few could even get close to
the venue's entrance.<
Director of The Cavern, Bill Heckle, said: ``Rock 'n' roll history will be
made tonight in Liverpool. It will be loud, hot and sweaty - just the way rock
'n' roll should be.<
``In size, the show is tiny - but its mark will be made all around the

Sir Paul looked in his element as he shook his head and swayed to the music
playing his familiar left-handed bass guitar.<
But during guitarist Dave Gilmour's solos he looked lost in thought and
contemplation.<
Delighted by the response of the eager crowd, who shook their arms and
shouted, he repeatedly asked them: ``Are you enjoying yourselves?''.<
His performance also included the classic Twenty Flight Rock, a favourite of
Sir Paul and John Lennon when they met in 1958.<
``There was one song and I knew the words to it. I think because I knew the
words to it, that's what got me in the Beatles,'' he said as he introduced it.<
His arrival on stage had been preceded by little ceremony.<
The silent room was simply told ``ladies and gentleman, with his band, Paul
McCartney''.<
The stage displayed nothing to show it was about to play host to one of the
world's most famous musicians, with just a simple projection of the name of the
club in white on a black background.<
After his fifth song, What It Is, Sir Paul voiced his excitement at being back
by telling the crowd ``it's good here innit'' to which one of the crowd shouted:
``Go on Macca lad.''<
Other songs included the classic All Shook Up, his new track Try Not to Cry
and he rounded off the main show with his Beatles standard I Saw Her Standing
There.<
The crowd shouted for their own favourites during a brief lull before he
launched into a single encore, but he told them with a grin: ``We're not doing
requests, we don't do requests.''<
After performing one bonus song, Party, he swept offstage teasing the crowd:
``Well, see you next time.''<
Fans won the right to see the show after their names were drawn in a ticket
raffle which took place last week, but half the crowd was made up of guests and
members of the press from around the world.<
Among those who saw the show was Jane King, 31, from Glossop, Derbyshire. <
She said: ``It was great to be here, but it was a bit of an anti-climax.<
``It just wasn't long enough. I've been a fan since I was about 13. The
highlight was when he played I Saw Her Standing There, because it was the one I
knew best.<
``I would have liked to have heard some of the older stuff, but I really
enjoyed it.''<
Also in the crowd was Hilary Medcalf, whose brother Roger had won tickets for
the pair of them.<
Hilary, 38, from Speke, Liverpool, said: ``I thought it was great, but I
thought it'd be much longer _ it didn't seem to be very long.<
``Paul was looking good and I thought he sounded great. I can imagine this is
what it was like in the old days, quite claustrophobic but a really good
atmosphere.''<

described the concert as short but sweet.<

It was a dream.<
``He seemed to enjoy himself at his homecoming and there's still nothing
better than this, absolutely nothing better.''<

VIAGRA PANTO JOKE `CORRUPTS CHILDREN' _ MARY WHITEHOUSE<
By Brian Farmer, PA News<
A Christmas pantomime in which the audience is asked to chant ``Viagra'' to
raise the gates of a castle has been criticised by decency campaigner Mary
Whitehouse.<
Mrs Whitehouse said the mention of the impotence drug during performances of
Jack and the Beanstalk at the Theatre Royal, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, was
``corrupting''.<
But theatre managers today insisted that they would not change the script,
written by comedian Roy Hudd, saying they had received no complaints from
customers.<
Mrs Whitehouse has not seen the play but raised her concerns in a local
newspaper.<
``It's corrupting their innocence and doing it at Christmas time as well,''
she said. ``I think it should be dropped.''<
But a theatre spokeswoman dismissed the criticism saying the use of the word
``Viagra'' was in the tradition of panto.<
``It's a joke that's meant for the parents and it gets lots of laughs. I have
no doubt that it goes straight over the heads of children,'' she said.<
``As in all pantos, there is a bit of mild sexual innuendo in the script. They
are jokes aimed at the adults in the audience.<
``We have had no complaints from anyone who has seen the panto, and we've been
playing to packed houses, so we don't plan to change the script.''<

CHARLES M. SCHULZ, CREATOR OF PEANUTS, TO RETIRE<
   <
   :: PR Newswire, London, December 14. This press release is transmitted on
behalf of United Media.<
   <
   New York - Charles M. (''Sparky'') Schulz, creator of the PEANUTS comic strip,
will retire January 4th, 2000. In a letter to his readers, colleagues, fellow
cartoonists and friends, Schulz wrote:<
   <
   ``I have always wanted to be a cartoonist, and I feel very blessed to have
been able to do what I love for almost 50 years. That all of you have embraced
Snoopy, Charlie Brown, Lucy and Linus and all the other PEANUTS characters has
been a constant motivation for me.<
   <
   ``It is important for me to tell you personally that I have decided to retire
from drawing the PEANUTS comic strip, after the daily release of Monday, January
3rd, 2000, (and Sunday release of February 13th), in order to concentrate on my
treatment for and recuperation from colon cancer. Although I feel better
following my recent surgery, I want to focus on my health and my family without
the worry of a daily deadline.<
   <
   ``Thank you for your kindness and support over the years and for the
outpouring of good wishes since my surgery.''<
   <
   In accordance with the wishes of Mr. Schulz, his last original daily strip
will appear on Monday, January 3rd, and his last original Sunday will appear on
February 6. Beginning on Tuesday, January 4th, for dailies (and February 20th
for Sundays), we will be offering our PEANUTS clients comic strips originally
drawn in 1974.<
   <
   The year 1974 was chosen as the roll-out year for Classic Peanuts because it
incorporates the characters of the strip's very early days (Charlie Brown, Lucy,
Schroeder and Snoopy) with popular characters that were introduced in later
years such as Peppermint Patty and Woodstock. The strips that he drew in 1974
unite the genius of comic timing and dialogue with the artwork of a master.<
   <
   On October 2, 1950, Charles M. Schulz's PEANUTS comic strip first appeared
in seven newspapers. Growing from that original seven to more than 2,600 today,
PEANUTS is the most widely syndicated comic strip in history. On a daily basis,
PEANUTS reaches more than 355 million readers in 75 countries and 21 languages.
Its timeless and endearing humor has expanded into more than 50 animated
television specials, more than 1,400 books selling 300 million copies, and four
feature films.<

TOO MUCH SEX ON TV, SAYS GRIMLEYS STAR<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
TV beauty Amanda Holden today criticised the levels of sex on television _ and
blamed directors for believing that was what the public wanted.<
The Grimleys star, who will soon be seen in a bath scene in BBC1's Happy
Birthday Shakespeare, said: ``I do think there's an awful lot of stuff on
television that is unnecessary, without wanting to sound like my grandmother.''<
She singled out the Robson Green ITV drama The Last Musketeer for its
inclusion of a topless scene which added nothing to the plot.<
``It's just typical of directors that they think the public want to see that
sort of thing. It's better left to hands, faces and noises.''<
Next month the actress, who has featured in a number of sitcom roles, will be
seen in a seven-part drama Hearts And Bones alongside Dervla Kirwan and The Full
Monty's Hugo Speer (correct).<
``There are a couple of scenes that involve sex in that show but they focus on
the faces. It's much more interesting than a***s and chests,'' she said.<
Holden, who has posed in her underwear for a men's magazine and appeared in
stockings and suspenders in The Grimleys, added: ``They should leave it to
people's imaginations.''<
The actress, married to Family Fortunes host Les Dennis, said her rising TV
profile meant she now felt more ``empowered'' to stand up and argue her case
that shows do not need such raunchy scenes.<
And she pointed out the extent of flesh displayed for her bath scene in Happy
Birthday Shakespeare, to be shown on Easter Sunday, had been exaggerated.<
``I keep reading articles about my first nude scene. I have bubbles up to my
chin and I had a bikini on,'' she said.<
In Hearts And Bones _ which begins in May _ Holden plays one of a group of
friends from Coventry who make new lives for themselves in London.<

JAGGER AND SCORSESE SET FOR FILM TEAM-UP<
By James Morrison, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Rock legend Mick Jagger is set to team up with acclaimed director Martin
Scorsese to film a no-holds-barred expose on the music business.<
The Rolling Stone is to co-write The Long Play with Scorsese, whose classic
movies include Taxi Driver, Goodfellas and boxing drama Raging Bull, a spokesman
said today.<
Jagger, 57, will share screenwriting credits with Scorsese and newcomer Rich
Cohen on the film, which will be based on his own experiences of the recording
industry.<
The spokesman said: ``I can confirm that Mick Jagger is working on a film
about the music business called The Long Play, and at this stage it is thought
Martin Scorsese will direct it.''<
Details of who would star in the movie had not been confirmed.<
The Long Play is just one of a number of film projects being planned by
Jagger's production company, Jagged.<
Among the others is The Map of Love, a biopic about the life of Welsh poet
Dylan Thomas and his wife, Caitlin.<
Jagged's first film, an adaptation of Robert Harris bestseller Enigma, is
currently in production, with pregnant Titanic star Kate Winslet in the lead
role.<
The thriller is directed by Michael Apted, who helmed the latest James Bond
film, The World is Not Enough, and co-scripted by award-winning Shakespeare in
Love screenwriter Sir Tom Stoppard.<

BECKHAMS THREATEN COURT BAN ON MORTON BOOK<
By James Morrison, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Royal author Andrew Morton is facing legal action to stop him writing a
biography of celebrity couple David and Victoria Beckham, it emerged today.<
The controversial writer, who has penned number one bestsellers on the late
Diana, Princess of Wales and Monica Lewinsky, is writing a joint profile of the
Spice Girl and her soccer ace husband.<
But today his publisher, Michael O'Mara, said he had received a letter from
the couple's solicitor threatening a legal injunction to prevent the book
hitting the shelves.<
``We've had a letter from solicitors representing the Beckhams saying they
will take out an injunction if we go ahead,'' he said. ``I think they are trying
to scare us off the subject, but I don't believe an attempt to go for an
injunction would succeed.''<
Mr O'Mara said Morton, whose books Diana: Her True Story and Monica's Story
caused storms when they were published, was currently researching his latest
project.<
He revealed that, as well as talking to a host of people with close personal
knowledge of the Beckhams, he would be approaching the couple themselves.<
``Andrew doesn't write slamming books,'' he said. ``He tries to write
well-rounded portraits.''<
A spokeswoman for the Spice Girls said earlier today she could not comment on
reports that the Beckhams had threatened Morton's publishers with an
injunction.<
The new biography, Posh and Becks: A Marriage, will explore what the
publishers describe as ``the truth behind the headlines'' about the celebrity
pair.<
As well as examining Victoria's relationships with her fellow Spice Girls, it
will look into David's with his team, Manchester United, and its manager, Sir
Alex Ferguson.<
The book will also consider the couple's status as ``king and queen of popular
culture'', while musing on the recent addition to their family in the form of
baby Brooklyn.<

PRODUCERS TURNED `DIRTY DAN INTO BALLET DANCER'<
By James Morrison, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
EastEnders star Craig Fairbrass has revealed how he chose to quit the hit soap
because his hardman character was starting to look like a ``ballet dancer''.<
The actor, whose character ``Dirty'' Dan Sullivan departs next week, told Now
magazine he initially loved playing the cad who two-timed Carol Jackson with her
daughter Bianca.<
But after later scripts saw him being rude to Peggy Mitchell and getting
beaten up by her husband Frank, he decided to quit.<
``It was `has Dan become a ballet dancer overnight?','' said Fairbrass. ``All
of a sudden, I'm getting my ears boxed by the likes of Frank. It was frustrating
and it aggravated and upset me.''<
The 34-year-old heart-throb added that the characterisation got even worse
after he complained to the show's producers.<
Fairbrass confirmed reports that he and actress Tamzin Outhwaite, who plays
Mel in the soap, were asked to tone down a passionate scene when it became too
heated.<
But he said that every time he had to kiss co-star Patsy Palmer (Bianca) she
burst out laughing.<
Following the Bianca/Carol storyline, he even had some indecent proposals from
real-life mothers and daughters.<
``The more horrible, the more of a bastard, the more women like you,'' he
said.<
Fairbrass also revealed how he has been cast in a science fiction movie, The
Lunatic Fringe, which he described as ``a cross between Mad Max and The Dirty
Dozen'', in which he will play a space marine.<

Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher and his actress wife Patsy Kensit are selling
their plush London home, it was reported tonight.<
Gallagher, 27, and Ms Kensit, 32, have put their townhouse in Primrose Hill,
north London, on the market, according to The Sun newspaper.<
Local estate agents Aston Chase have been instructed to offer the four-storey
Victorian property for #1.5 million, the paper said.<
The sale has led to speculation that the pair's rocky three-year marriage may
be over, just eight months after the birth of their son Lennon.<

DIS MORNING I IS ALI G<
By James Morrison, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
This Morning host Richard Madeley today bowed to pressure to change his
trademark layered hairstyle - by adopting the look of spoof rapper Ali G.<
The presenter swapped his usual dapper image to sport a bright yellow shell
suit and hat at the start of the ITV programme.<
Madeley even sported Ali G's beard and spoke in his distinctive ``gangsta
lingo'' as he discussed ideas he had for the show with bemused co-host Judy
Finnigan.<
As Finnigan struggled to keep a straight face, Madeley said: ``I 'as some
ideas here for Dis Morning. I would like to run some things past you.''<
In a fun swipe at the show's traditional makeover slot, he joked: ``Why does
you bother wid all these makeovers? Why don't you just get women who is fit to
start with?''<
When Finnigan said she was not prepared to present the whole programme with
Madeley dressed as Ali G, he asked: ``Is it because I is black?''<
Madeley's new look followed a phone-in poll on yesterday's show giving viewers
the chance to vote on which of four celebrities he should try to emulate.<
More than 50% of voters said he should opt for Ali G chic, as opposed to the
images of Travis lead singer Fran Healy, footballer David Beckham or long-haired
Changing Rooms style guru Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen.<
The poll followed an article in Saturday's edition of The Sun poking fun at
Madeley for retaining the same hairstyle since he first appeared on This Morning
a decade ago.<

SIMPSONS ACTORS HEADING FOR BRITAIN<
By James Morrison, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
The actors whose voices are behind the cult cartoon sitcom The Simpsons are
flying to Britain to stage live readings of scripts from the show.<
A unique tour of key festival venues is being staged to coincide with the 10th
anniversary of the internationally acclaimed series later this summer.<
While a similar read-through was held at the Aspen Comedy Festival earlier
this year, this is the first time such a venture has been staged in the UK.<
Series creator Matt Groening said today: ``We are looking forward to this tour
and hope to do to England and Scotland what the Simpsons have done to America.<
``I think the most amazing thing is that the actors really look like the
characters that they play.''<
David Bergg, general manager of Sky One, which is organising the tour to
celebrate the birthday of the series, which it has screened since its 1990
launch, added: ``Like all Simpsons fans, I'm thrilled that the people behind one
of the best television programmes in history are bringing some of the magic over
to Britain for its 10th anniversary.''<
The brief tour will kick off at the Edinburgh fringe festival, with a
performance at The Assembly Rooms on Monday August 14.<
It will be followed by two more shows, on Thursday August 17 and Friday 18.<
The show's celebrations will also include a one-day Simpsons event at London's
National Film Theatre, followed by a weekend of special programmes on Sky One.<
All the actors who provide the voices for the principal Simpsons characters
will be present at the events, including Dan Castellaneta, alias Homer, Nancy
Cartwright (Bart) and Yeardley Smith (Lisa).<

`INTERNET STALKER TARGETING WINSLET'<
By Mick McGann, PA News<
Titanic star Kate Winslet is being targeted by an internet stalker who has
sent several email death threats to a fan club website, her New York-based agent
said tonight.<
Robert Garlock said police were contacted after the 24-year-old actress's
London agents, Peters, Fraser and Dunlop, received an email warning that she may
be in danger.<
Mr Garlock would not comment further.<
According to The Mirror newspaper, the stalker is female, and the email was
headed ``Winslet stalker info _ urgent!'', and read: ``There could be harm for
Kate.''<
In a string of emails to the unofficial Kate Winslet Fan Club site, the
stalker, who calls herself Dina, says she will visit London and wants to
``rape'', ``kill'' and ``hit'' the pregnant star.<
Another message, referring to Winslet's new home in Britain, said: ``That flat
sounds cool ... I can get her addy (internet slang for address) then!!
hahaaaaa.''<
The messages have been traced to the literature department of the Aristotle
University in Thessalonica, Greece.<
Winslet had to take action under the Protection from Harassment Act two years
ago when a man claiming to be a photographer began following her around.<
The man was eventually arrested, warned to stop stalking her and freed without
charge.<
Winslet, who is expecting her first child in September, has recently returned
home after filming Enigma, the movie based on Robert Harris's novel about
wartime code-breakers.<

The charity premiere of new James Bond film The World is Not Enough opens
today in aid of endangered children.<
The World is Not Enough promises to captivate its audience at the Odeon in
London's Leicester Square with a nail-biting opening scene featuring actor
Pierce Brosnan landing on the roof of the Millennium Dome, following a
high-speed boat chase on the River Thames.<
Proceeds from today's screening will be donated to the Children's Promise
which is helping children who have been physically abused and are in danger.<
The film's producers Michael Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said: ``It is
refreshing to have a brand new icon featuring right at the beginning of our
film.<
``The Dome is photogenic and we believe it makes the opening sequence exciting
and fun.''<
Children's Promise brings together seven leading charities which are asking
people to donate their final hour's earnings of the millennium to their
charities.<
ChildLine, Barnardo's, BBC Children in Need and Comic Relief are just some of

DIAMONDS STILL FOREVER FOR BOND'S GIRL<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
James Bond leapt back into action tonight at the premiere of the new 007
movie, but it was the girl on his arm that dazzled the crowds _ draped in jewels
worth a cool #3.5 million.<
Pierce Brosnan's girlfriend, Keeley Shaye Smith, wore a necklace with 51
diamonds and a pair of matching earrings as the couple arrived in London's
Leicester Square.<
They were among the guests at a star-studded event to launch Bond's 19th movie
The World is not Enough <
Stage and screen veteran Dame Judi Dench also pleased the crowds by arriving
with her husband, the actor Michael Williams who was diagnosed with lung cancer
in the summer.<
Williams has made few public appearances since his condition became apparent
in August, but he was on the arm of Dame Judi _ who plays M in the new film _ as
the couple arrived at the Odeon, where Bond movies are traditionally launched.<
The signs are that the latest outing for the suave agent will be as successful
as the previous movies with the film going straight to the top of the US box
office chart over the weekend.<
It had its biggest opening weekend to date, taking #23.25 million _ beating
previous Bond record holder, Goldeneye, which took #16.3 million.<
Brosnan, appearing for the third time as Bond, wore a dark tuxedo with a
blue-grey waistcoat as he arrived tonight, rather than the dinner suit and black
tie for which the screen hardman is best known.<
He topped it off with a diamond and pearl pin from Asprey & Garrard which also
supplied the jewels for Shaye Smith.<
She wore a dark claret silk dress designed by Richard Tyler.<

Since the first 007 film, Dr No in 1962, the films have been renowned for the
glamour of the Bond girls and tonight's premiere was no exception.<
US actress Denise Richards, who plays Dr Christmas Jones, wore a powder pink
dress which sparkled as it caught the light as she arrived with director Michael
Apted.<
Maria Grazia Cucinotta _ the curiously named Cigar Girl in the film _ wore a
plunging black dress, while Sophie Marceau (who plays Elektra, the daughter of a
British oil tycoon) wore an eyecatching tropical print dress split to the
thigh.<
Brosnan, 47, said as he arrived: ``The story's very good and hopefully I
played the part in a convincing manner.<
``This is my third outing. When it works really well no other film stands up
to it.''<
Asked is there were any hairy moments during filming, the Irish actor said:
``There are always a lot of hairy moments _ just going to work in the morning
was hairy.''<
Robert Carlyle, the evil Renard, said: ``It's always nice playing a baddie. I
really enjoy filming.<
``Pierce is one of the nicest men I've ever met. He made me feel really
welcome.''<
Other guests at the premiere, which raised money for the Children's Promise
charity, included Sir Paul McCartney, former Six Million Dollar Man star Lee
Majors, Desmond Llewellyn, who plays Q, and Robbie Coltrane.<
Pregnant Emma Thompson was accompanied by her partner Greg Wise.<
Guests were due to attend a party at the Naval and Military Club in London _
popularly known as the In and Out Club _ following the premiere tonight.<
Commander Bond has now been made a member of the club and was making his first
appearance there.<

promoting the Charles Dickens' classic as a festive cracker.<
The new adaptation will feature alongside comedies The Vicar of Dibley, The

EastEnders, Casualty and Holby City will also retain their usual slots.<
BBC1 controller Peter Salmon said: ``Every year we save some really special
things to put in the Christmas sack, and this year - the last of the century -
we have created the ultimate toy box to keep the viewers amused for the whole
fortnight.<
``I can't think of a better way to wish our viewers the best of times than
through the creative genius of our programme makers.<
``With The Vicar of Dibley promising to be a real event, Dervla Kirwan in the
heart-warming story the Greatest Store in the World and the unique historical

families and friends together this Christmas.''<
Other BBC1 Christmas highlights include a modern day Christmas fairy tale

Cilla Black won the ratings battle of the redheads as Blind Date pulled in
three million more viewers than Lulu's new National Lottery show.<
The first edition of the new series of Cilla's long-running show had an
average of 9.7 million viewers on Saturday against Red Alert With The National
Lottery's 6.3 million.<
A spokeswoman for London Weekend Television, which makes Blind Date, said they
were delighted with the audience.<
The programmes _ both fronted by Sixties singing icons who hosted their own
shows three decades ago _ were pitched head-to-head, starting at 7.10pm.<
Blind Date's format has survived into its 15th series while Lulu's programme
was already being tweaked in just the second show. The voice of TV darts, Sid
Waddell, was dropped.<
A spokeswoman for Red Alert said: ``How many times do we have to say we're not
in a ratings battle with ITV?<
``What we are about is offering something new. This is a new show and we're
the only channel that is trying to do something new for Saturday nights.''<
Richard Whiteley's pilot programme for BBC1 on Friday night was, however, a
ratings winner for the Beeb.<
His Unbriefed show _ in which he is unaware of who the guests are beforehand _
had an audience of 5.5 million compared to Ian Wright's ITV chat show Friday
Night's All Wright which had 3.3 million viewers.<
Whiteley said: ``I'm quietly thrilled that 5.5 million people would rather
watch me than get last orders in the pub. But Michael Parkinson doesn't have

NEW SOAP SPEARHEADS BBC DAYTIME DRIVE<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
BBC1 is to produce a new soap set in a GP's practice to spearhead its daytime
schedules, it was announced today.<
The new series - provisionally titled The Practice - is being overseen by
former Brookside producer Mal Young and will begin filming in January, following
the lives of the doctors and nurses.<
Another new show, A Family Of My Own, will look at children in care and will
encourage families to consider adoption.<
``This is an important initiative for daytime and a great example of the
public service broadcasting we aim to provide,'' said Jane Lush, the BBC's head
of daytime TV.<
The BBC has been working with the Department of Health, social services and
fostering and adoption agencies throughout the UK to produce the show, which
will be presented by Sally Magnusson.<
Each show will feature case studies of children available for adoption chosen
by social services, as well as success stories of families that have
successfully adopted.<
The shows are a move away from the game shows, light entertainment and chat
that have become synonymous with daytime programmes.<
Ms Lush said: ``BBC Daytime will offer viewers a real alternative to other
channels with programming of range and ambition that will reflect and complement
their own lives.<
``BBC Daytime is the viewers' friend and I hope the audience will consider
their time well spent watching the programmes we have lined up.''<
Some new shows will be shown before Christmas. These include Classic Cafe,
which to be broadcast once a week live from the newly revamped Royal Opera House
in Covent Garden and focusing on the world of opera, ballet and dance.<
And on BBC2 Lowri Turner will present Shopping City which will be broadcast
live from Manchester's Trafford Centre.<
Other forthcoming shows include Passport To The Sun, presented by Channel 4's
Big Breakfast star Liza Tarbuck from the Spanish island of Majorca and Maternity
Hospital in which Sue Cook looks behind the scenes at St Mary's Hospital in
Manchester.<
Alice Beer and Diarmud Gavin present gardening show Real Rakeovers and David
Dickinson will give an insider's guide to the world of collectibles in Bargain
Hunt.<
Earlier this year BBC Daytime was hit by the scandal of fake guests on The
Vanessa Show and poor ratings. It was eventually axed.<
Ms Lush said: ``This has been a challenging year for BBC Daytime but we are
making real progress.<
``BBC Daytime is not only committed to providing the audience with bold, fresh
and innovative ideas that will entertain but also programming that is both
ambitious and relevant to our audience.''<

By James Morrison, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Fans of cult radio soap The Archers will tonight hear one of its steamiest
ever scenes _ when local flirt Jolene shares an after-sex shower with adulterous
landlord Sid Perks.<
The long-running series, set in the fictional village of Ambridge, has had its
fair share of controversies since its first broadcast in January 1951.<
Over the last 49 years the ostensibly innocent and gentle chronicle of country
life has been criticised for its use of swear words and the often violent deaths
which have befallen its characters.<
But tonight's episode is set to put all but a few earlier ``scandals'' in the
shade when married landlord Perks is heard sharing a shower with seductress
Jolene and discussing with her their preceding sex romp.<
Speculation about the exact nature of the clinch has been rife for some time,
although Archers producers have remained tight-lipped.<
Controversy erupted after editor Vanessa Whitburn was reported as saying it
would be more ``explicit'' than the series had ever been before, with
Canterbury's Tory MP, Julian Brazier, accusing the programme of going too far.<
A Radio Four spokesman on Wednesday confirmed the long-awaited scene would be
included in tonight's episode, but declined to give any details of exactly what
it contained.<

BBC DENIES EASTENDERS IS SET FOR EXTRA NIGHT<
By James Morrison, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
BBC chiefs today moved to quash speculation that top-rated soap EastEnders was
poised to go on air four nights a week.<
A report in tomorrow's issue of industry journal Broadcast claims proposals to
increase the number of weekly episodes from three to four have been under
discussion ``for some time''.<
It cites the arrival of incoming director general Greg Dyke, who takes over
from Sir John Birt on Saturday, as the reason it has been put back on the
agenda.<
But the BBC's drama commissioner for series and serials, Alan Ayres, today
denied there was any prospect of a fourth regular episode of EastEnders in the
foreseeable future.<
``We've no plans to introduce a fourth episode of EastEnders,'' he said.
``Nothing is ever off the agenda completely, but there are no plans of this
sort.''<
At present, EastEnders regularly attracts audiences of more than 16 million
for its thrice-weekly episodes, on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays, and its
Sunday afternoon omnibus edition.<

LAMARR HEADS FOR NEW LOOK<
By James Morrison, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News.<
Comedian Mark Lamarr will shave off his trademark ``Fifties throwback'' hair
style live on the Big Breakfast, he said today.<
The 32-year-old star will be given the chop by presenter and friend Gail
Porter during Monday's episode of the Channel 4 breakfast show - the day before
he embarks on a nationwide stand-up tour.<
And the hair will be auctioned with proceeds going to his chosen charity,
World Vision.<
Lamarr, whose distinctive oiled quiff has become known to millions since he
first found fame on Channel 4's The Word, said he was taking the drastic action
because he is bored of people mentioning it.<
``I did about 30 interviews last week and every single person asked me about
my hair and Gail Porter, so I thought if I get Gail to cut it off live on the
Big Breakfast that should end it once and for all,'' he said.<
``It seems strange to me that I've been a stand-up for 15 years and people go
on about this, when it has absolutely no input into my style.''<
He added: ``I suppose I will miss it, in a way. It's been a constant companion
to me for so long. I feel like I'm drowning an unwanted kitten.<
``The weirdest thing will be to find out what shape my head really is.<
``I've thought for ages `I've got to get a new hair style', but I've always
had another series to do, so I've ended up thinking `well, I'll just do this
series first'.''<
Despite being willing to shed his locks, Lamarr is adamant he does not want a
totally bald head.<
``It'll probably be a crew cut or something, but I'll have to have words with
Gail beforehand to warn her,'' he said.<
``When I first started wearing glasses, on the first night I went out on stage
someone yelled out straight away `you four-eyed git', so it will probably be
`baldy' next time.''<

FRUITFUL CELEBRITIES CHOSE EXOTIC NAMES<
By Damien Pearse, PA News<
Rock star Noel Gallagher and his wife Meg Mathews are the latest in a string
of celebrities to choose an unusual name for their offspring _ by naming the
baby after the author of erotic French novels.<
The name Anais is by tradition a French Christian name, derived from the Greek
meaning ``fruitful''.<
It gained a certain notoriety from the French writer Anais Nin _ Meg's
favourite author _ though it is probably best known in this country as the name
of a perfume.<
The Gallagher baby will join a generation of youngsters given unconventional
names by their superstar parents.<
Noel's own brother Liam and his wife Patsy named their child Lennon, after the
Oasis singer's idol John Lennon.<
Perhaps the most notable of recent arrivals is Brooklyn Beckham, child of
Manchester United star David Beckham and his pop star wife Posh Spice, named
after his place of conception.<
Spice Girl Mel B, recently split from her husband Jimmy Gulzar, named her
daughter Phoenix Chi.<
Meanwhile TV presenter Jonathan Ross, known for his parental devotion, named
his children Honey Kinney, Harvey Kirby and Betty Kitten.<
Singer Madonna decided to call her baby Lourdes, while American screen beauty
Demi Moore chose Rumer for her daughter.<
Other unusual names are Maia Rose, given to the baby of former Eastenders star
Michelle Collins and Michael Jackson's baby Prince.<

NOEL WEEPS TEARS OF JOY AFTER DAUGHTER'S BIRTH<
By Damien Pearse and Nell Raven, PA News<
Oasis star Noel Gallagher burst into tears as his wife gave birth to a baby
girl today - then nipped to a nearby pub for a pint of Guinness.<
He described the experience as ``the best thing ever'' and said everything had
gone to plan.<
His wife Meg Mathews gave birth to the 7lb 6oz baby at the Portland Hospital
in central London at 1.17pm.<
The couple have named the child Anais after Meg's favourite French author
Anais Nin. Anais means ``fruitful'' in Greek.<
Noel was present throughout the induced birth, which was not due for another
two weeks.<
He said: ``It was that big that the doctor said it was best to take it out
before it got any bigger.''<
The musician's mother Peggy and Meg's mother Chris were also at the hospital
along with her best friend Fran Cutler and the couple's housekeeper.<
Speaking from a pub opposite the hospital, Noel said the baby had blonde hair
and blue eyes and looked like her mother.<
``You feel a bit of an idiot standing there but once it's happened it's the
best thing ever,'' he said.<
``I'm still shaking. I thought there was going to be lots of screaming and
shouting all the way through but there wasn't.<
``Everything's worked out as we hoped it would.''<
Noel said his wife had coped admirably with the pain of labour.<
``It's just like she's been shopping. She looks fantastic - she doesn't even
look like she's had a baby.''<
Asked whether he had found the experience emotional he replied: ``I was crying
a lot.''<
Despite the happy scene at the hospital Noel decided to head for the nearest
pub to celebrate.<
``They were all drinking champagne and I don't like champagne so I came to the
pub,'' he said.<
According to Noel the baby was conceived at Christian Dior's house in
Montreaux, while he was making his latest album Standing On The Shoulder of
Giants.<
He said Meg would probably be staying at the hospital until the weekend, but
they hoped to be able to leave in time to attend the Mike Tyson v Julius Francis
fight in Manchester on Saturday.<
Describing how it felt to be a father Noel said: ``It might bring out my
feminine side and all that.''<
He said his mother was overjoyed at the news.<
``She's got three boys. This is the only girl in the family apart from her,''
the star added.<
Last year Noel, 32, and Meg, 33, quit London to live in a #2.5 million mansion
in Buckinghamshire.<
Meg, a builder's daughter who was brought up in Norfolk, said one of the
reasons for moving out of London was because she did not want to raise children
in the capital.<
She met her superstar husband in 1994 before joining Oasis's record company
Creation where she helped organise after show parties.<
Soon after marrying Noel in 1997 Meg left Creation to set up her own company 2
Active with Ms Cutler.<
Gallagher's brother Liam became a father for the first time five months ago
when his wife Patsy Kensit gave birth to a baby boy, Lennon.<

The 7lb 2oz child was born at about 1pm after Ms Mathews arrived at the
undisclosed hospital at 8am.<
Gallagher was at the hospital throughout although it was unclear whether he
witnessed the birth, the star's spokesman said.<
``They are both absolutely delighted,'' the spokesman added.<
Before the birth Ms Mathews was visited at a west London hotel by a host of
stars including supermodel Kate Moss.<
The celebrity party organiser announced she had been circuit training and
sticking to a healthy diet ahead of the birth.<

WEIGHT LOSS DID WORRY ME _ POSH<
By Emma Hibbs, PA News<
Posh Spice decided to go to doctors after being afraid that she was losing too
much weight, she has disclosed.<
Victoria made the admission in an interview with Michael Parkinson, to be
broadcast on BBC1 at 9.30pm tomorrow.<
The wife of England soccer star David Beckham said: ``It did worry me. I did
go to the doctors, it worried me because I started to get paranoid so I went to
the doctors and said look, is there anything wrong with me. I wanted to be
totally checked out because I was eating perfectly fine, exactly as I always
have done, and I was losing weight.<
  ``They just said it's just something that happens when you have children. My
mum lost three stone after she had my brother, so it's hereditary. I think that
I could probably do with putting on weight but I just eat what I eat and this is
the way I am.<
``I'd have breakfast, lunch, dinner and a snack in between. Normal. It's quite
embarrassing, I was out at dinner the other night and I was eating and I ordered
a bowl of pasta and the man said would you like a large bowl or a small bowl,
you feel such an idiot. I've just got used to it now, I don't care what anybody
says.<
``We were out at dinner the other day and I was absolutely bursting for the
toilet and it's quite sad to think you can't even go to the toilet because if
you do, people are going to think you're throwing up.<
``What really freaked me out about the whole weight issue wasn't actually the
weight issue in the end, it was the fact that in the past if I'd been in the
press I'd been with the Spice Girls or with David and for the first time it was
just me.<
``I was completely singled out and I think it was the whole attention, just
the fact that people were that interested in me, that kind of freaked me out
more than anything really.''<
Victoria also said that the couple had hired a bodyguard for son Brooklyn
following kidnap threats.<

Victoria told how she had stepped up security following the recent kidnap
threats to her and Brooklyn.<
She said: ``It's a lot more worrying because I've got a baby. There's been lot
of stuff in the press about people wanting to kidnap Brooklyn.<
``That was serious, I did have threats, the police were fantastic. Brooklyn
has a bodyguard with him now.<
``It's something that's really worrying, that's every parent's worst
nightmare, something happening to their child. That's scary.''<
Although Brooklyn is not yet a year old, Victoria has signed him up for a
private school.<
She said: ``Do you know there is only one place left in his class as well. A
lot of parents put their names down for school before they are actually even
born these days.<
``I am going to send him to a private school in the country. I'm not going to
send him to Eton or anywhere like that but I'm putting his name down at lots of
different schools up north and down south.<
``You know, who knows where he will be. I have to be so bloody diplomatic all
the time it drives me mad.''<
She also denied having gone under the surgeon's knife. She said: ``I haven't
had a boob job ... if I'd had a boob job done I would have done them bigger than
this. That's all I can say.''<

CELLIST JULIAN STEPS OUT WITH HIS NEW LOVE<
By James Morrison, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News.<
Cellist Julian Lloyd Webber today stepped out in public for the first time
with the new love in his life.<
The 48-year-old musician, who divorced his wife Zohra last year, attended the
South Bank Show Awards at London's Savoy Hotel with 27-year-old girlfriend Roz
Hamandishe.<
After the ceremony, the couple spoke for the first time about how they met and
fell in love.<
And Zimbabwe-born Roz, who once appeared on Cilla Black's Blind Date, revealed
how she only found out who Julian was when she saw his gold discs arranged in
his toilet.<
Julian, who performed a funky, Brazilian-sounding version of the original
South Bank Show theme tune by his brother Lord Lloyd-Webber at the start of
today's event, said: ``We met just over a year ago, just before Christmas 1998.<
``I was in Brixton with some friends and went into this restaurant where Roz
was with her friends. Some of us already knew each other so we got talking. ``We
started out as friends, but for the past two or three months we've been seeing
increasingly more of each other.'' He added: ``It's very important to me to know
that I'm valued by someone for myself and I like to be with someone who's a
non-practising musician because otherwise it can get too claustrophobic.<
``I appreciate the fact that Roz is from a different background. That is very
important to me.''<
Roz, who lives alone in Surrey and works for a London-based recruitment
agency, said: ``We value our independence. I'm a working girl.''<
But she added: ``Julian is down-to-earth, sensitive, very passionate, and he
has lots of energy and zest for life.''<
Asked about the 21-year age gap between them, Roz said: ``I like Julian's
maturity - and his immaturity.''<
Now the couple is bound for Australia and New Zealand, where Julian is
embarking on an extensive tour next month.<
Roz said: ``I will be helping him carry his equipment and holding his hand
when he gets nervous.''<
After that, Julian is due to perform the Elgar Concerto at the Royal Albert
Hall in aid of a charity masterclass for young musicians, and he has plans to
release a CD of Brazilian-tinged jazz - including the rewritten South Bank Show
theme.<

ISLE OF MAN TO ISSUE BEE GEES STAMPS<
By Jackie Burdon, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Six stamps honouring the Bee Gees are to be issued by the island of their
birth _ where their mother once ran a Post Office.<
I've Gotta Get A Message To You was aptly one of the global hits to be
commemorated on the set of Isle Of Man stamps to be issued on October 12.<
``Not many people realise the Bee Gees were born here _ most people think they
come from Manchester or Australia,'' said an Isle of Man Post Office spokesman.<
All but the youngest musical brother Andy were born on the Isle of Man, and
eldest brother Barry was nine by the time the family moved to Manchester in
1955.<
Parents Hugh and Barbara and troubled Andy returned to the island in the
1970s, where Barbara ran the Union Mills sub-post office for some years.<
Due to rules surrounding the royal approval of stamps, none of the Bee Gees'
faces actually appear on the issue. Instead designs showed a CD, a map of the
Isle of Man and one of the Bee Gees song titles.<
Last year the surviving trio Barry, Robin and Maurice paid tribute to their
homeland by recording Ellan Vannin, the island's unofficial anthem.<
They now play it at all their concerts, against a backdrop of the island's
stunning scenery.<
Their spokeswoman said: ``We are very honoured that these stamps are being
issued.<
``The Isle of Man is part of the band's history, and the stamps link them to
the island in a very concrete way.''<
The island had influenced their music, she said.<
``This is an opportunity to increase worldwide recognition of the Isle of Man,
so in a way it is a pay back.<
``It is not infrequent that they pop over there, and certainly their mother
was on the Isle of Man this summer to say hello to old friends.<
``They have a lot of friends there and they are hoping to go back there and do
a commemorative concert in the future.''<
The stamps were being released to mark the 50th birthdays of twins Robin and
Maurice on December 22.<
I've Gotta Get A Message To You, a British number one in 1968, was the 29p
denomination.<
Other songs on the stamps from the brothers' long and hit-filled career were
Massachusetts (22p), Words (26p), Ellan Vannin (37p), You Win Again (38p), Night
Fever (66p), Stayin' Alive (90p) and last year's release Immortality (60p).<
Stamp expert Peter Jennings said: ``These attractive and unusual stamps will
be much sought after by fans of the Bee Gees as well as by stamp collectors and
non-collectors alike. They are a wonderful souvenir of a legendary pop group
from the Isle of Man.''<

SPICE GIRLS JOIN MILLENNIUM SINGLE LINE-UP<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
The Spice Girls have been recruited to join the growing list of stars on the
BBC's Millennium single It's Only Rock 'n' Roll.<
The group recorded their section of the song last week, performing a line of
the 1974 Rolling Stones hit which will also feature Fun Lovin' Criminals, Annie
Lennox and James Brown.<
It follows the success of the Children In Need record Perfect Day which
brought together numerous musical superstars and reached number one.<
The Spice Girls have notched up Christmas chart-toppers for the past three
years but in recent interviews have cast doubt about whether they will release a
seasonal single this December.<
However, the BBC song is to be released to figure in the first chart of the
year 2000, so the girls could make up for it by featuring on the first number
one of the Millennium.<
Ten artists have recorded their sections of the song including Jon Bon Jovi,
James Brown and Chrissie Hynde.<
Also understood to have been approached for the project - expected to feature
20 acts - are Stevie Wonder, BB King and members of the Womack family.<
A video is being produced to accompany the single.<
A BBC spokeswoman said: ``It's going to have the same sort of atmosphere as
the Perfect Day video but the essence of it will be these artists shaking their
thing.''<

JUST THE TICKETS AS ROYAL OPERA HOUSE BOX OFFICE REOPENS<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Eager ticket hunters were among the first members of the public to see inside
the massively redeveloped Royal Opera House today when the box office was
reopening ready for the building's relaunch in December.<
Waiting to welcome the first opera and ballet fans to cross the threshold at
around 8am will be Royal Ballet star Darcey Bussell.<
But visitors will have to wait until later in the year to see the #214 million
redevelopment in all its glory with access restricted tomorrow to just the box
office area.<
More than 87,000 tickets go on sale today and a round-the-clock phone booking
operation swings into operation to cope with expected demand.<
Phone lines will be open for 48 hours from 8am Monday to 8am Wednesday. After
that the lines will operate from 10am to 8pm from Monday to Saturday.<
A spokeswoman said: ``We are expecting a big surge at the beginning. We also
get a lot of bookings from overseas, from the Far East and America, and it is
going to be very useful for them.<
``They can call at a time that suits them, not just when Greenwich Mean Time
dictates.<
``The personal callers on Monday will be the first members of the public
through the doors.''<
The Royal Opera House will reopen to the public with a gala celebration on
December 4 after a #214 million rebuild _ nearly 29 months after the curtain
last came down.<
The main auditorium has a capacity of around 2,200, while the studio theatre
seats about 450.<
The December 4 event features performances from tenor Placido Domingo who is
guesting with The Royal Opera. Among The Royal Ballet guest artists are Sylvie
Guillem and Viviana Durante.<
A similar presentation three days earlier will be primarily for contributors
towards the redevelopment.<
On December 6, The Royal Opera opens its first season with a new production of
Verdi's Falstaff. Two days later, The Royal Ballet begins its season with A
Celebration of International Choreography.<
Last week officials announced the redevelopment appeal had raised #95 million
of its #100 million target.<
Together with the #78.5 million National Lottery award and the income from
shops in the new building in Covent Garden, central London, the appeal will
cover the #214 million redevelopment cost. Ten donors have given more than #1
million.<
  This autumn a seat-naming campaign will begin to continue the fund-raising
push.<

REVAMPED OPERA HOUSE THROWS OPEN ITS DOORS<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
The Royal Opera House threw its doors open to the public today for the first
time in more than two years as tickets for the new season went on sale.<
Many hardy opera-goers spent the night on the pavement to secure their seats,
while others joined them this morning to line the covered walkway outside the
revamped building in London's Covent Garden.<
The main auditorium will reopen to the public with a gala celebration on
December 4 after a #214 million rebuild _ nearly 29 months after the curtain
last came down.<
Early arrivals as the box office opened at 8am were greeted by Royal Ballet
star Darcey Bussell who was pleased with the turnout.<
``I was a bit worried so I brought my mum along to make up the numbers,'' she
said.<
``It's wonderful to see it like this today. It was hard to keep morale going
as we jumped in and out of different theatres while the doors were closed for
two years.''<
Although it was just the box office which most visitors saw today, some were
given a sneak preview of the main hall, much of which is still coated in plastic
until the opening proper.<
To meet the huge demand for tickets, the Opera House also opened a
round-the-clock phone booking service which will continue for 48 hours until 8am
on Wednesday. After that it will become a 10am to 8pm line.<
Among those towards the front of the queue was Milan Hasecic, one of five
Cambridge University students who has spent the night outside the building.<
The 26-year-old PhD student from Belgrade said: ``We are very much looking
forward to seeing the new establishment _ it is completely transformed from the
last time we were here. And it's great to have access from the centre of Covent
Garden rather than just hiding away as it did before.''<
Actress Dera Cooper was an early riser to secure her seat. <
``I was quite clever _ I got a taxi at 4am and got here at 4.30. But the
person next to me had been here all night and I'm ever so pleased,'' she said.<
``I've slept out before when the Kirov and the Bolshoi were here and I slept
on a lilo on the pavement. But I thought I'd give it up now I've got a little
older.<
``I'm a Friend of the Opera House so I had booked some performances ahead but
I happened to be walking around here last night and saw the queues and thought,
'why not give it a go,'  and get tickets for the opening celebration. It will be
something unique.<
``I've been coming here for years and years. Once you're bitten with the bug
it's like an illness.''<
Ms Cooper said it was wonderful to see the Opera House so near to completion.<
``I'm going to write to Chris Smith to thank him because I don't think this
would have been possible under the previous government.''<

queue by 5.10am and get hold of tickets for a performance of Falstaff.<
``I'm very much looking forward to it,'' said Mr Rivers, a Friend of the ROH
who has been a visitor to the ROH since 1958.<
``People who like this sort of thing are pretty loyal,'' he added.<
David Dalby, of Islington, north London, cycled down to queue for tickets for
four productions - including the opening night with Placido Domingo and The
Royal Ballet's staging of The Nutcracker.<
``I timed it perfectly. I got here at 5am but one of the people next to me was
here at 11pm last night,'' he said.<
``Part of the reason for my extensive booking was that it my partner's
mother's 90th birthday is coming up so there are a couple of treats for her.''<
``I had been to the old Opera House a few times but I mainly go to the English
National Opera.<
On seeing the queues, Michael Kaiser, executive director of the ROH, said:
``I'm absolutely thrilled because what it shows is that so many people want to
come to this Opera House and the interest in opera and ballet is so strong - as
is the interest in the institution.<
American Mr Kaiser joined the Opera House 11 months ago after a number of
high-profile departures and criticism of the institution by the Culture Select
Committee and the Eyre Report.<
``When I came there were lots of challenges, but it's a beautifully planned
project which has been ongoing for many years and the result of a lot of hard
work.<
``There is some controversy still and I have to make a lot of decisions. Just
from speaking to people in the queue this morning I find that a lot of people
have completely opposing views on exactly the same issue.<
``I think what we've done is changed the emphasis more to people's hopes for
the future of this building and not dwell too much on the history. Let's let it
lie there and go forward.''<
The redevelopment costs are being financed through a #78 million National
Lottery grant, proceeds from sales of shops in the new building complex and a
#100 million appeal.<
Only #5 million more needs to be raised to meet the appeal target and Mr
Kaiser is quietly confident that it will be met.<
``It is always hard work to raise money but we feel very comfortable that we
can do that,'' he said.<

MEL'S MISSES MERSEYSIDE DERBY TO KICK OFF WORLD TOUR<
By Maria Breslin, PA News<
Spice Girl Mel C kicked off her solo world tour tonight and complained that
her hometown gig clashed with the Merseyside derby.<
Sporty, clad in a Liverpool Football Club away strip shirt and carrying a team
scarf, said she was looking forward to the show and playing in front of a home
crowd.<
But lifelong Liverpool supporter Mel joked: ``I'm gutted I'm missing the
match. I can't believe it's the same night as the derby. I mean, whose bad
planning was that, eh?''<
Nursing a cold, Spice Girl Mel said she had been assured she would be kept up
to date with the latest score from the wings of Liverpool's Royal Court
Theatre.<
The opening tour date coincides with the release of her first solo single
Goin' Down which she said was penned in Dublin and was about a failed
relationship.<
Goin' Down is taken from her first solo album Northern Star which is due to be
released in October.<
She denied there were any songs inspired by former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell
or her alleged relationship with Robbie Williams.<
The Spice Girl admitted her appearances over the summer had received a mixed
reaction but urged her fans to give her new songs a chance.<
She said the other Spice Girls had given their blessing to her whirlwind solo
tour adding that they were all really supportive of each other's projects.<
The 25-year-old also played down recent reports of her latest earnings and
also ruled out a life as a tax exile saying: ``I'm quite happy to pay my taxes.
I have got enough money, I want to give it to people who haven't.''<
The tour also includes dates in America and Australia.<

`NAUGHTY' MEL WINDOW-SHOPS HUNKS FOR TV SHOW<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Happily married Spice Girl Mel G picked some of the guests for her new music
TV show because she fancies them, she revealed today.<
The singer, whose black music series Pure Naughty begins on BBC2 on Sunday
afternoon, said: ``You can still window-shop when you're married, but you can't
buy.<
``I don't want to buy - I've got my husband and I'm madly in love,'' added the
star who married a year ago.<
Mel said she drew up a ``dream list'' of who she wanted to meet, although one
of her fantasy men Wesley Snipes will not be appearing.<
Her three Spice Girls colleagues might also put in an appearance on the
series, Mel revealed today<
``They want to come on it. I said `no way, you're not black'. That was a joke.
No, their faces might crop up on it from behind the sofa or something.<
``We always like to be involved in each other's stuff.''<
The music and talk show will be her first TV presenting role and will feature
music stars like TQ, DJ Krust and Saul Williams and Lynden David Hall.<
However there will also be white acts like former New Kids On The Block star
Jordan Knight and the mainly white Another Level.<
Executive producer of the show Angela Ferreira said: ``It's more to do with
the spirit of the music than the colour of the skin.''<
Mel, 24, has also branched out into a solo music career and modelled at London
Fashion Week but said her priorities work-wise were the Spice Girls and Pure
Naughty.<
She said: ``Between the four of us the predominant thing that dominates our
lives is the Spice Girls, but we have time off to do our own thing.''<
Baby Spice Emma Bunton also becomes a TV presenter next month with a slot on
the VH1 music channel.<

OASIS ALBUM TOP OF THE SECONDHAND SHOPS<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Be Here Now, by rock superstars Oasis has topped a chart as the least wanted
album of the year, a survey showed today.<
The record - the fastest selling album when issued back in 1997 - tops a list
of releases most frequently passed on to secondhand shops in 1999.<
The backhanded honour for the Gallagher brothers comes in the survey, compiled
by music magazine Melody Maker, which also saw the band cropping up again at
number nine with their b-sides album The Masterplan.<
Be Here Now prompted Oasis-mania when it was launched around the world. Sales
in the UK during its first day on the shelves were more than a third of a
million on the first day and reached 696,000 within three days.<
But the album was poorly received by critics and many fans thought the long
drawn-out tracks were a shadow of the songs in the first two albums Definitely
Maybe and (What's The Story) Morning Glory?<
Rock band Kula Shaker, who split last year, were also a turn-off with music
fans, with debut album K coming second in the secondhand chart, ahead of Spiders
by Space.<
Urban Hymns, The Verve's acclaimed 1998 album which also sold in huge
quantities, cropped up at number seven.<
And even the charms of superstars like Tom Jones and Robbie Williams wear off,
the chart reveals.<
Williams' I've Been Expecting You - containing his first solo number one
Millennium - was at number 18 and Jones' covers album Reload was 19.<
The survey will appear in next week's edition of Melody Maker.<
Top 10:<
1. Be Here Now - Oasis.<
2. K - Kula Shaker.<
3. Spiders - Space.<
4. Post Orgasmic Chill - Skunk Anansie.<
5. Believe - Cher.<
6. Magic Treehouse - Ooberman.<
7. Urban Hymns - The Verve.<
8. Villa Elaine - Remy Zero.<
9. The Masterplan.<
10. Rides - Reef.<

VICTORIA'S INTERVIEWS SET TO RAISE EYEBROWS<
Posh Spice Victoria Beckham reveals a candid side to her personality when she
hosts her first chat show, it was reported today.<
The singer, who earlier this week told television viewers that her soccer star
husband David wears her underwear, is seen interviewing guests such as
footballer-turned-actor Vinnie Jones, James Bond star Roger Moore, presenter
Ruby Wax and even her husband.<
But it is her asides to the camera which are likely to raise eyebrows.<
The Daily Mail says that while interviewing the designer Valentino, she
launches a verbal attack on supermodel Naomi Campbell.<
``We are going to see Val,'' Mrs Beckham tells viewers. ``I'm going to ask him
if Naomi Campbell really is a complete bitch because every time I have met her
she has been a complete bitch.<
``She is a massive cow.''<
Earlier this week the 24-year-old singer told Channel 4's Big Breakfast how
her husband preferred to wear her g-strings.<
Speaking about her relationship with Beckham, Victoria said: ``He likes to
borrow my knickers.''<
During her chat show, called Victoria's Secrets to be shown on Channel 4 next
Tuesday, she says she knows nothing about football or her husband's talent for
free-kicks.<
``I do go to football sometimes,'' she says. ``I don't know the offside rule
or free kicks...or side kicks...or whatever they're called.<
``I know what he (Beckham) does. He kind of bends the ball that way or
something, you know.''<

I'M THRILLED, SAYS STREET'S NEW ROSIE<
By Sinead McIntyre, PA News<
A nine-year-old girl was celebrating today after beating off dozens of young
hopefuls to win the part of Coronation Street's Rosie Webster.<
Helen Flannagan, of Bolton, Greater Manchester, will step into the shoes
vacated by Emma Collinge, on January 23.<
Helen, who lives with her parents and older brother and sister, said she was
delighted to have been chosen for the part and added: ``I'm thrilled to be
working with such kind people.''<
Emma announced her decision to quit the show last month after playing Sally
and Kevin's eldest daughter since she was 10 days old, telling Coronation Street
chiefs that she wanted to donate more time to her gymnastics.<
She made her farewell appearance as Rosie on New Year's Eve.<
Now Helen will take over the part of the little girl who has been at the
centre of tough storylines which saw her parents break up and Rosie become a
bully.<
Helen, who has attended the Carol Godby Theatre Workshop in Bury since she was
five, has also appeared in a number of commercials.<
A Coronation Street spokeswoman said: ``We are pleased to welcome Helen to the
cast _ she's really excited about the part I think her family have been champing
at the bit to tell people.<
``She's a very pleasant girl and we think she will fit in very well with the
rest of the cast.''<

CATHERINE `TO SIGN AGREEMENT BEFORE MARRYING DOUGLAS'<
Catherine Zeta Jones is to sign a pre-nuptial agreement which will safeguard
her future husband Michael Douglas's massive fortune, it was reported today.<
The Welsh actress has agreed to sign the agreement in case the marriage fails
after Douglas paid #44 million to his former wife Diandra, according to The
Sun.<
The Hollywood actor and Ms Zeta Jones announced yesterday they are to marry.<
Douglas, 55, who spent Christmas with the 30-year-old actress in Wales, ended
months of speculation by saying: ``I am very happy to announce that I am engaged
to Catherine Zeta Jones.''<
But a source told the newspaper lawyers had been working for weeks on the
contract to protect Douglas's #180 million fortune.<
``Catherine has money she has earned from films but it pales into
insignificance compared to Michael's,'' the source told the paper.<
The Basic Instinct star was married to Diandra for 22 years and as well as the
money handed her his Californian mansion after the break-up.<
The source told the paper: ``Michael bears no animosity towards his ex-wife
and she certainly got a good deal.<
``He was keen to get the details finalised so it left him free to marry
Catherine.''<
Douglas, son of screen legend Kirk Douglas, disclosed that he proposed as the
couple celebrated the dawn of the new millennium at his home in the Rocky
Mountains, and surprised Jones with a 1920s ring from Fred Leighton.<
The ring contains a 10-carat diamond surrounded by 28 smaller stones.<
Douglas said in an announcement on his personal website: ``I proposed to
Catherine on New Year's Eve at my house in Aspen.''<
He added that the couple had not yet set any official date for the wedding,
but that they planned to marry later this year.<

By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Newly-engaged actress Catherine Zeta Jones had a further reason to celebrate
today after signing a multi million-pound Hollywood deal for her company to make
up to 12 movies.<
The Welsh star is making her first foray into film production with her company
Zeta Films after starring in hit films like Entrapment and The Haunting.<
Zeta Jones _ who is to marry screen star Michael Douglas, himself an Oscar
winning producer _ is teaming up with Initial Entertainment Group to make the
films, according to Hollywood bible Variety.<
The two-year deal means her company _ run by the actress and brother Lyndon _
will co-produce two to six pictures a year with budgets from #5 million to #50
million.<
It emerged yesterday that Zeta Jones, 30, got engaged to 55-year-old Douglas
on New Year's Eve after he popped the question at his home in Aspen, Colorado.
The actress's brother David is a senior figure at IEG which is believed to have
helped smooth the deal. The company _ behind Leonardo DiCaprio's forthcoming
Gangs Of New York _ will finance the films.<
Zeta Jones said: ``IEG has assembled a great work force and I respect them,
both on a business level and a creative level. I look forward to being part of
the team.''<
She is reported to have signed a pre-nuptial agreement to safeguard her future
husband Michael Douglas's massive fortune.<
He is already thought to have shelled out more than #40 million in a
settlement to end his marriage to first wife Diandra.<
There is speculation that the couple will marry at Clyne Chapel, just a few
hundred yards form her family home in Swansea Bay.<
Douglas was producer of the Oscar-winning One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest as
well as the huge box office hits Romancing The Stone and The Jewel Of The Nile,
which he also starred in.<
