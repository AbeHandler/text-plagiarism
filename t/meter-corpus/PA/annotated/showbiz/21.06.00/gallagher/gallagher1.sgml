LIAM AND PATSY `SELLING UP'<
By Nick Mead, PA News<
Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher and his actress wife Patsy Kensit are selling
their plush London home, it was reported tonight.<
Gallagher, 27, and Ms Kensit, 32, have put their townhouse in Primrose Hill,
north London, on the market, according to The Sun newspaper.<
Local estate agents Aston Chase have been instructed to offer the four-storey
Victorian property for #1.5 million, the paper said.<
The sale has led to speculation that the pair's rocky three-year marriage may
be over, just eight months after the birth of their son Lennon.<
Twice-divorced Ms Kensit was admitted to a clinic last month suffering from
depression and anxiety.<
