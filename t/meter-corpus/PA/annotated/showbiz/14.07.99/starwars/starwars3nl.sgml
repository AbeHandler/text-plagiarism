Stars from the pop world at the premiere included Billie, Texas singer Sharleen
Spiteri, Queen guitarist Brian May and 13-year-old singing star Charlotte
Church.<
Also at the event was newsreader Trevor McDonald, who got a bigger cheer than
actor Denis Lawson, McGregor's uncle who starred in the early Star Wars films
but was barely recognised by the crowd. <
To the bemusement of fans, a lookalike of Natalie Portman's character, Queen
Amidala, appeared on the balcony overlooking Leicester Square and silently
surveyed the scene.<
The Phantom Menace is a prequel to the three other Star Wars films and goes
back to the beginning of the story 30 years before the first space swashbuckler
was set.<
Huge queues are expected at cinemas around the UK when the film opens
tomorrow.<
