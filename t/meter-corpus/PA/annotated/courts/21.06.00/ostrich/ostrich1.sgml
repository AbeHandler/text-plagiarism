BROTHERS CLEARED IN OSTRICH CASE<
By Graham Hiscott, PA News<
Two brothers were today found not guilty of helping to run an alleged scam to
breed ostriches.<
A jury at Leicester Crown Court deliberated for a total of 15 hours before
returning verdicts in the case of Kevin Jones, 41, and Russell Jones, 42, both
of Cantley near Doncaster, South Yorkshire.<
Both denied conspiracy to defraud during the three-month trial which centred
on the Ostrich Farming Corporation, a company which attracted 2,700 investors
including former ITN news reader Fiona Armstong.<
