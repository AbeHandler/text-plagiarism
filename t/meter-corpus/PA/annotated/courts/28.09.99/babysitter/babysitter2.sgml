mother Annette, had bathed her and put her to bed.<

any problems to contact Molly's aunt, Janet Adams, who lived further along
Duchess Road in Crumpsall, Manchester.<
The defendant later knocked on the door of Ms Adams' house and said there was
something wrong with the child.<
Molly was found in her cot with a small patch of blood below her nose.<
Her face was white with dark purple patches. She was limp and did not appear
to be breathing.<
