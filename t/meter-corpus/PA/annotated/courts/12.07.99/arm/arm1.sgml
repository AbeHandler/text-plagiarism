TIMBER FIRM IN COURT OVER ARM-LOSS ACCIDENT<
By James Morrison, PA News<
A family timber firm will be sentenced today after admitting liability for an
accident which led to a teenage worker losing his arm.<
The company, Wenban-Smith, of Newlands Road, Worthing, West Sussex, pleaded
guilty last month to three health and safety offences in relation to the injury
to 17-year-old Tom Harrocks.<
Mr Harrocks had to have his left arm amputated after it became caught in the
screw mechanism of a wood waste extraction silo on December 22 last year.<
At a hearing before Worthing Magistrates company director Harry Honsa admitted
on behalf of the company failing to take measures to prevent access to the screw
mechanism, failing to ensure that everyone using it had adequate training, and
failing to fully assess the risks to employees.<
The magistrates committed the case for sentence at Chichester Crown Court
after deciding the maximum fine of #5,000 they had the power to impose was
``insufficient''.<
