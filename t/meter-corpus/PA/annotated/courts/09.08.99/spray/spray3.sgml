Summing up today His Honour Judge Stuart Fish said the jury had to decide
whether Pc Bateson's response was reasonable in the circumstances described.<
Judge Fish said: ``Even if he was mistaken and misguided in the view that he
took on the position in which she found herself, if he held that view honestly
it is a matter for you to decide if the response was reasonable.''<
