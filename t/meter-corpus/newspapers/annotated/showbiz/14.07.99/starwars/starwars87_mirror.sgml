<New PAsource="" >AFTER months of hype, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Star Wars: The Phantom Menace </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had its </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >royal premiere last night</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" > - and my fears came true.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The movie </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >has already received</Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" > a lukewarm reception </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >from the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >critics.</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >

Likewise, the premiere got the cold shoulder by Britain's superstars. Oh, and yours truly.

I mean where were Noel and Liam? Kate Moss? Even the Spice Girls, who'd turn up to the opening of an envelope, failed to show on this occasion.

Obviously </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Princes William </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Harry </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >can't be huge fans - </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Prince Charles </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >turned up without them. And where was </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Liam Neeson, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >one of the film's stars?

Me? I went home, splashed fresh paint on the kitchen wall and spent a highly enjoyable evening watching it dry. Meanwhile </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the thousands of </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >ordinary folk </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who crowded into </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Leicester Square </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had to make do with a motley collection of microcelebrities.

Among them were 5ive singer Rich, Gail Porter's mum Irene, EastEnder Carol Harrison (Tiffs mum) and, er, Jamie Theakston's girlfriend Bev Turner. 

Oh, and adding a dash of glam, 60s icon Marianne Faithfull.

 The organiaation inside the cinema underlined the dismal atmosphere of the evening. When my man James was about to grab a word with director George Lucas, he was rudely pulled Away. 

Another PR blunder.

No wonder </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Ewan McGregor, who plays Obi-Wan Kenobi </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in the flick,</Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" > looked so miserable </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >when he arrived at </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Odeon.</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >

Those who did give their considered opinion on the film included </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Queen guitarist Brian May </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and Eurythmic Dave Stewart, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >singer </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Charlotte Church </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >and </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Holby City </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >actresses </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Lisa Faulkner and Angela Griffin.</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >
</New>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >After the film the guests were taken to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a party </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >held on a disused parking lot near </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Tower Bridge </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >- How glamorous.

Even then many of the guests struggled to get tickets as it seems the 20th Century Fox PR people had failed to do their sums properly.</New>
