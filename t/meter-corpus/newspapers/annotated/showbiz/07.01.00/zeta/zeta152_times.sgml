WHILE much of the world's press worried yesterday about whether Catherine Zeta-Jones would sign a pre-nuptial agreement to stop her getting her hands on Michael Douglas's fortune, the Welsh actress was quietly making herself and her family richer without recourse to her fiancé's wealth.

On the same day that her engagement was announced, a new production company called Zeta Films was formed in Beverly Hills and was signing a film financing deal worth more than £60 million.

Zeta Films, which is owned by the 29-year-old actress and other members of her family, signed an exclusive two-year deal with the Initial Entertainment Group.

Under the deal, Initial will finance and co-produce between two and six Zeta Films-produced movies annually with budgets ranging from £3 million to £30 million. Ms Zeta-Jones's brother, Lyndon Jones, will acquire and develop scripts and ideas for the company, while her other brother, David Jones, is a vice-president in charge of creative affairs at Initial.

Initial is the company behind the latest Robert Altman film Dr T. and the Women and made Gangs of New York which stars Leonardo DiCaprio and was directed by Martin Scorsese.
