Six stamps honouring the Bee Gees are to be issued by the island of their birth - the Isle of Man, where their mother ran a post office. I've Gotta Get a Message to You is aptly one of their hits to be commemorated on the stamps to be issued on October 12. Because of the rules of royal approval of stamps, none of the Bee Gees' faces actually appears on the issue. Instead designs show a CD, a map of the island and one of several song titles.
