<New PAsource="" >The 50-year-old will present two more shows before his four-year contract ends next March. </New>
<New PAsource="" >'I suspect I will bid a fond goodbye before I get too stale and before I get too frustrated,' said Edmonds. 'I feel demotivated to a point where I sadly feel it's time to say goodbye.'

<New PAsource="" >One senior corporation executive said last night, however: 'His ratings had been falling for some time and he wasn't the solid bet he once was. Noel has been clever and has struck first, knowing he was on his way out. </New>

</New>

<New PAsource="" >Edmonds said: 'If the BBC said tomorrow that the new show is fantastic, I would have to say, "I don't think you have got the resources to make it happen". That is the sadness.'
</New>

<New PAsource="" >He was 'heartbroken' because accountants had taken over from programme makers.

<New PAsource="" >'Name something that is currently on BBC1 that gets people excited and talking about it, he said. 'You're struggling.'

</New>

<New PAsource="" >'As for his other programme ideas, they simply didn't fit in with the BBC. They weren't particularly new or good.'</New>
