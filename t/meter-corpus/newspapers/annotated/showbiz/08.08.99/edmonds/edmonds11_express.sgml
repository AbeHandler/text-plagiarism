<New PAsource="" >"I feel demotivated to a point where sadly it is time to say goodbye. Name something current on BBC1 that gets people excited and talking about it. You're struggling."
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Sources inside the BBC claim that Edmonds' accusations are unfair and that he has himself to blame for declining ratings.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >"He has been a spent force for a couple of years," said one insider. "He was acting like an impotent monarch - raging at everyone around him but not himself."

Edmonds has been at loggerheads with BBC chiefs since ratings for Noel's House Party went into freefall last year.
