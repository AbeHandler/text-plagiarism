YIPPEE! It looks like Cliff Richard's awful Millennium Prayer is about to be overtaken in the race to be the Christmas No 1.

Bizarre have discovered Westlife's double A-side I Have A Dream/Seasons In The Sun is edging ahead, with sales of 39,000 so far this week, compared with 36,000 for Cliff's dirge.

John Lennon's Imagine is third with sales of 32,000. The Cuban Boys and Steps are close behind.
