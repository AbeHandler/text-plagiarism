<New PAsource="" >WORRIED </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >BBC </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >bosses looked about to lose another of their star attractions yesterday. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Blackadder </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was said to be on </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >his </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >way to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >rival Sky </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >TV.
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >But </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >in a twist worthy of one of Baldrick's cunning plans, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the BBC </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >immediately denied it </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >and accused Sky of dishonesty.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >According to a spokeswoman, Sky bid around £4 million to secure exclusive rights to </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Time for Blackadder, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >millennium special </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >featuring </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Rowan Atkinson, Tony Robinson </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and Stephen Fry as well as guest stars including Kate Moss and Colin Firth.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >The "poaching" follows Des Lynam's departure to ITV and Harry Enfield's £1million deal with Sky. </New>
<New PAsource="" >It is particularly embarrassing for </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the BBC </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >because their </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Head of </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Television </New>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >is an </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >executive producer </Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Bad feeling </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >between the </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >two companies </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >reached boiling point last night </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >with </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the BBC </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >insisting that no </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >deal </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had been done. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >A </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >spokeswoman told The Express: "There is not and cannot be a deal, The BBC owns the rights to the name Blackadder and no deal can be signed without our consent."
</New>

<New PAsource="" >"What Sky have said is utterly inaccurate. To be frank, it is a lie." </New>
<New PAsource="" >But </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a Sky </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >spokeswoman responded: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"We have a deal. We've agreed terms. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >We have a binding agreement. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The BBC </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >is </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >obviously having </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >difficulty coming </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to terms with their loss."
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >The comedy feature, </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >which will mark Blackadder's first appearance in a decade and is expected to be his last, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was commissioned as an attraction for the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Millennium Dome.

<Rewrite PAsource="" >It </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >will be shown exclusively </Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >before reaching home TVs </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >early </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >2001. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >The story will have </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Blackadder and Baldrick </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >travelling </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >through history in </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >time machine.
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >During their trawl through history, they encounter figures like Robin Hood and Maid Marian, played by Rik Mayall and Kate Moss, and Shakespeare, played by Colin Firth.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Elisabeth Murdoch, head of Sky Networks, said: "This very clever, funny script is being brought to life by the best of British talent on both sides of the camera. To have secured the exclusive UK television rights is tremendous news."
