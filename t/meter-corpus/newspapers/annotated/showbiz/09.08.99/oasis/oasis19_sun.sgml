It is believed tension mounted between Bonehead and the Gallaghers because he is seen as an outsider. He refused to move from his native Manchester to London when the band hit the big time.

He is currently spending £500,000 of his £5million Oasis fortune on having a recording studio built in his mansion at Bowden, Cheshire. Added to that is the fact that he supports Manchester United while the Gallaghers are avid City fans.
