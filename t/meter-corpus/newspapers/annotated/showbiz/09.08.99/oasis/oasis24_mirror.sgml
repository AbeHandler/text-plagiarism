<Verbatim PAsource="" >"After a lot of consideration I have decided to call it a day with Oasis.

Last night band insiders insisted that Oasis would continue to function, but I can reveal that Bonehead's resignation came as a complete surprise for his former colleagues.

A source close to the group told me: "Liam and Noel knew nothing of this. They're absolutely gobsmacked. There are a lot of worried phone calls going on at the moment."

Bonehead earned around £6 million of the £35 million generated by the band's record sales and concerts. But he had struggled to come to terms with the death of his father three years ago, and he hit the bottle in a manner that was excessive even by the wild Manchester band's boozing standards.

Arrested

An insider told me: "He's the oldest member of the band and for him the novelty of jetting round the world and staying in five-star hotels has passed. He's set for life and Paul has realised that there's a lot more to life than being a rock star. There are no bad feelings between him and the boys - they respect his decision to go."

Only recently the strain of life in the fast lane was beginning to show. </New>

<New PAsource="" >Bonehead, clearly the worse for wear, got into a row with the doormen.

He was arrested for being drunk and disorderly and got locked up in a nearby police station.

On the home front, he tired of the lack of privacy and constant abuse from jealous locals.

But unlike the Gallaghers, Paul and his wife, Kate, elected to stay close to his northern roots, moving four months ago into a £600,000 home in the village of Bowden near Manchester.
