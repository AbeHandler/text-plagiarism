<New PAsource="" >JOHN Major is set to upstage his party's autumn conference from beyond the political grave.

The former prime minister has made a bitter personal attack on his predecessor Margaret Thatcher, dismissing her conduct during his seven year government as "intolerable".

The charge came during 30 hours of interviews for </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The Major Years, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >a new BBC1 series. The interview will be shown in October, just as the Conservatives arrive in Blackpool.

It will dramatically undermine what is intended to be a major opportunity for William Hague to relaunch his new front-bench team.

Major also shocked BBC staff by becoming tearful as he recalled his impoverished south London childhood and the snobbishness he has faced ever since. "It is absolutely compelling," said one BBC insider. "You see a side of him that few have ever imagined."

But it is the indictment of his party which will attract as much attention. Major describes Lady Thatcher's downfall as a "daylight assassination" which was the start of a "Greek tragedy" for the Tories.

Asked by Denys Blakeway about Lady Thatcher's failure to back him when he stood for election as party leader in 1995, he explains bitterly: "In retrospect I think her behaviour was intolerable. I hope none of my successors are ever treated in that way"

Lady Thatcher's claim that she would be a good backseat driver after Major's election as Tory leader had "already driven a wedge between us", he explained.

Sir Edward Heath, one of the senior Tories also interviewed for the series, added: "Some historians will say John Major was too nice." </New>
