An 18-year-old won the backing of a high court judge yesterday to keep her new-born baby with her in prison. The mother, remanded in custody on a robbery charge, was granted bail 'in principle' so she can prove her parenting skills at a hostel in Liverpool. She had been refused entry to Holloway prison's mother and baby unit, in north London, because of her 'volatile behaviour'.
