A BUSINESSWOMAN was yesterday given a two-year suspended jail sentence after stealing nearly £300,000 from investors who poured money into her OSTRICH farm. Esther Evans, 36, of Swansea, was also banned from being involved in a company for 10 years. Husband Martin Evans, 38, was also due to stand trial but did not turn up for the start of the hearing, and has not been seen since.
