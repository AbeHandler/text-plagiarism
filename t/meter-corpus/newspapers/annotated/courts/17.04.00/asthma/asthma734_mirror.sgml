A NURSE yesterday won £157,000 damages after she contracted asthma through using hospital equipment. Mother-of-five Fostina Brobbey, 58, had worked as a theatre nurse for 25 years but was forced to retire through ill health.

She won her damages - one of the largest ever for asthma - from North Manchester NHS trust.

After the hearing she said: 'I wake up coughing, unable to breath. But nursing is the only job I've ever done and I really loved it.'
