<Verbatim PAsource="" >Francis </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >built a multi-million pound drug-dealing empire while being paid to wean kids off crack.

<New PAsource="" >He duped police chiefs, MPs, and church ministers as the respected team leader of the Crack Awareness Team, set up to lure youngsters AWAY from drugs.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Francis, 37, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had worked for a year as an adviser to prostitutes before landing the Home Office-funded anti-drugs job.

</New>

<New PAsource="" >He sported a £30,000 watch, dripped in gold jewellery and had diamonds drilled into his TEETH - hence his nickname.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Francis </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >spent six weeks at a time holidaying at five-star hotels in Jamaica, yet still claimed the Job Seekers Allowance.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Detectives long suspected his lavish lifestyle was funded by crime, but could not touch him.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >A host of figures in authority including Notts Police Assistant Chief Constable Robin Searle, local MP Alan Simpson, the Rev Pat Brown, whose crack-addicted daughter was one of Francis's clients, and Association for the Prevention of Addiction chairman Sir Geoffrey Errington - all fell for Francis' deception. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Even when some cried foul, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Francis </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >claimed race discrimination to the authorities and menacingly warned off others. </New>
<New PAsource="" >His reign ended when he quit the CAT team after four years and police swooped on a council house he'd rented in Nottingham. Prosecutor </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Andrew Easteal </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >told Nottingham Crown Court yesterday: "When searched, Francis's pockets were quite literally bulging with cash."

<Verbatim PAsource="" >half a kilo of heroin with a street value of </Verbatim>

</Rewrite>

<New PAsource="" >They nicked the baron's network of street dealers in a swoop called Operation Diamondback.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Francis, 37, was jailed for seven years. He admitted possessing heroin with intent to supply.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Judge Dudley Bennett </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >said: "You more than anybody else should have known the misery of people who have become addicted." </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Stephen Warner, 33, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Woolaton, Nottingham </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >- described as one of Francis's "lieutenants" in court - </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >caged </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >for five years.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Christopher Powell, 21, of Thornton Heath, Surrey, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >who helped ferry the drugs to Francis's home, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >got </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >five and a half years.
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >After the case, police revealed that Francis's drug-dealing business was set up like a pyramid - with him at the top.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >His lieutenants bought drugs in bulk from main suppliers in London and Birmingham, while at the bottom of the pyramid were his street dealers - many of them schoolchildren. A Notts police insider said: "He has been a thorn in our side for 20 years. He knew who all the addicts were and where they lived."
</New>

<New PAsource="" >"We suspected he had been a major dealer for many years, but he moved in influential political circles and appeared a credible character to the authorities. </New>
<New PAsource="" >He was arrogant ... but then he began to make mistakes."
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Despite a history of crime from the age of 14, Francis built up a status as the "Saint of the Streets", a reformed crook helping others.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >But one detective said: "You've got to question how a man in a £12,000-a-year job could achieve his kind of lifestyle. It's good news for everyone he's behind bars. Our worry now is that there may be an underworld power vacuum left by his imprisonment."
</New>

<New PAsource="" >One of Francis's anti-drugs co-workers even blew the whistle three years ago.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Tony Herbert, who quit over the anti-addiction association's lack of action, told an investigation: "I was told by people well established in the commercial side of illegal drugs that David was involved in heroin and crack cocaine coming from London and Birmingham."
</New>

<New PAsource="" >"I have also been told that David was known to be involved in the supply of firearms and the availability of women for prostitution."
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Some 20 other workers told similar stories. But the association cleared Francis. The drugs baron wrote to the association claiming "I feel I am regarded as nothing more than a black gangster."
</New>

<New PAsource="" >A police insider said: "He managed to get away with it for so long because anytime anyone went near him he cried racism.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >"Fellow workers were told that their allegations were defamatory and one person was suspended and accused of racial harassment."
