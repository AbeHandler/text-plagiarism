<New PAsource="" >WITH his £50,000 Mercedes, £30,000 wrist watch and diamonds set in his teeth, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Dave </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Francis </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >looked like the Hollywood stereotype of a drug dealer.</New>


<New PAsource="" >But although his £12,000 annual salary hardly matched his lifestyle, for years his role in the war on drugs was accepted.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Politicians feted him as head of a pioneering drug rehabilitation unit in inner city </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Nottingham.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >An apparently charming, eloquent man, he was even invited to give evidence before a Parliamentary select committee.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Yesterday, however, justice finally caught up with </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >37</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >-year-old </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Francis </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >when he was jailed for seven years after being caught with </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >heroin </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >worth £72,000.</New>


<New PAsource="" >As the full extent of his deceit was finally exposed it emerged that Francis, former head of the Home Office-funded Crack Awareness Team, had tapped into a ready-made market, supplying drugs to the people he was supposed to be helping quit. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Nottingham Crown Court </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >heard how Francis and his 'lieutenants' were caught with </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >half a kilo of heroin. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Francis </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >admitted possessing the drug </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >with intent to supply.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Judge Dudley Bennett </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >told him: 'What you have admitted is being a distributor of drugs in Nottingham.'</New>


<New PAsource="" >'I have to deal with people day after day in this court who appear before me after committing crimes to fund their drug habit.'</New>


<New PAsource="" >'Because of your involvement in the past with trying to stop all that in your work, you more than anybody else should have known the misery of people who had become addicted.'</New>


<New PAsource="" >Two members of Francis's gang were also jailed. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Stephen Warner, 33, of Wollaton, Nottingham, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >described in court as one of his lieutenants, was given five years for possession of heroin with intent to supply </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Christopher Powell, 21, of Thornton Heath, Surrey, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >who helped ferry the heroin to Francis's home in the exclusive Nottingham suburb of Compton Acres, received </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >five and half years </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >for two charges of possession with intent to supply.</New> 


<New PAsource="" >For years the people of inner city </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Nottingnam </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had identified </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Francis </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >as a drugs baron but he carried on living like a millionaire in the belief that he was untouchable.</New>


<New PAsource="" >With his open-topped Mercedes SLK car, designer clothing and gold jewellery, he was idolised by disaffected youths. </New>
<New PAsource="" >One detective said: 'Francis would drive through the streets of Nottingham in his car with the stereo blaring, his wealth on display.'</New>


<New PAsource="" >He had spent years building up relationships with powerful voices in the city before resigning from the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Crack Awareness Team </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >in 1997, ending a four-year tenure.</New>


<New PAsource="" >So convincing was his charade that when he faced an Inquiry by the Association for the Prevention of Addiction, a charity that oversaw his drug project, the Labour MP for Nottingham South, Alan Simpson, was deceived and said </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Francis </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was the victim of malicious rumours.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Police mounted </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Operatior Odin </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >to catch </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Francis </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >after pooling years of intelligence on the man they believed was the city's number one supplier of heroin and crack cocaine. </New>
<New PAsource="" >They believe his lieutenants bought the drugs in London and Birmingham and that he used boys as young as 12 to ferry drugs on mountain bikes around Nottingham's St Ann's and Meadows estates. </New>
<New PAsource="" >In February last year police raided a council house which Francis rented on St Ann's. </New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Andrew Easteal, prosecuting, said: </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >'When searched Francis's pockets were quite literally bulging with cash.' </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >As a result of the swoop, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >132 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >street </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >dealers, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >most linked to Francis, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >were later arrested. </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >A Nottinghamshire Police source said: 'He had been a thorn in our side for 20 years and was becoming more and more so as the years went by. </New>
<New PAsource="" >'We suspected he had been a major dealer for year but he moved in influential political circles and appeared a credible character to the authorities.'</New>
