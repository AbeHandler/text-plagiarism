<New PAsource="" >A WORKER for an anti-drugs project used his contacts to build up his own drugs empire. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >David Francis, 37, </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Francis </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >drove around </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Nottingham </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >in the open-topped car with his wealth on display. </New>
<New PAsource="" >A police source said: "He was a role model for teenagers and young men in the black community. They saw how easy it was for him to get what he wanted and they felt they should be able to do the same."</New>


<New PAsource="" >Police said that </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Francis </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >believed that he had become untouchable after building up influence with politicians who thought he was a credible anti-drugs worker. </New>
<New PAsource="" >At </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Nottingham Crown Court </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >he was jailed for seven years.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Francis </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >admitted possessing heroin </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >with a street value of </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >£72,000 with intent to supply. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Judge Dudley Bennett </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >allowed a conspiracy charge to lie on the file after police said that pursuing it in court could release details of sensitive surveillance techniques. </New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Andrew Easteal, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for the prosecution, </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >said that in 1993 </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Francis </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was appointed head of a crack awareness team set up by the Association for the Prevention of Addiction. </New>
<New PAsource="" >The charity received £3.5 million from the Government and the National Lottery.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Despite a record of crime from the age of 14, he built up a reputation as a reformed criminal helping others. He attended anti-drugs policy meetings with Nottinghamshire's assistant chief constable.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Francis </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >built up a database of addicts whom he later planned to supply. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Nottinghamshire police believe that he ran a pyramid business, using boys as young as 12 to ferry drugs on mountain bikes around city estates. He employed dealers, providing them with cars and money to buy in bulk from suppliers in London and Birmingham.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Francis, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >who stayed in five-star hotels in Jamaica for six weeks while on a job seeker's allowance after he left the charity, was said to have had the support of Alan Simpson, the city's Labour MP, who publicly told doubters that </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Francis </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was the victim of malicious gossip.</New>


<New PAsource="" >His activities were exposed in February last year when under cover police raided a council house and caught him with dealers and </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >half a </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >kilogram of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >heroin. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >More than 130 street dealers were arrested in the weeks after Francis's arrest. He was believed to be Nottingham's main supplier of heroin and crack cocaine. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Judge Bennett </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >told him: "You more than anybody else should have known the misery of people who had become addicted."</New>


<New PAsource="" >A police source said yesterday: "He had been a thorn in our side for some 20 years and was becoming more and more so as the years went by. Francis believed he had become untouchable. He was arrogant but then he began to make mistakes."</New>


<New PAsource="" >An inquiry in 1997 by the charity cleared him of allegations of dealing. A spokesman for the charity, renamed Addaction, said yesterday that it had acted within the constraints of employment law.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Police are expected to apply for an audit of Francis's assets to seize the proceeds of his drug dealing.</New>


<New PAsource="" >In the same case </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Stephen Warner, 33, of Nottingham, was jailed for five years </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for </Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >five-and-a-half years </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >for two similar charges. </New>
<New PAsource="" >A warrant was issued for the arrest of a third man.</New>


<New PAsource="" >A spokesman for Nottinghamshire police said investigations such as that involving Frances were vital if police were to make an impact on the drugs problem. "We will continue to target those offenders who bring drugs into Nottinghamshire and sell them to children and adults on our streets."</New>
