<Verbatim PAsource="" >composer </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >told the high court </Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >that he had gone about </New>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >by other artists. </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >Simon </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Burstein </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >is seeking damages for what he calls a "straightforward lie".</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >He told the jury: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >I just couldn't believe it. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >I just looked at </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >[the diary story] </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in disbelief, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and then was shocked and dismayed. </New>
<New PAsource="" >I thought, if people believe what they have said, then I have lost my personal and professional credibility</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The item, in 1997, referred to a forthcoming </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >concert. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >It </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"The music is by Keith Burstein, an aggressively self-righteous, rather slushy composer who used to organise bands of hecklers to go about wrecking performances of modern atonal music, particularly anything by Sir Harrison Birtwistle."</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The judge, Richard Walker, has ruled as a matter of law that the words are libellous, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the jury </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >is being asked to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >decide the </Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >which Mr Burstein's solicitor advocate said should be between £20,000 and £50,000. </New>


<New PAsource="" >In the witness box Mr </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Burstein </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >admitted </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >that he did </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >once </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"voice disapproval" at a performance of Sir Harrison Birtwistle's work, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and had </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"heckled and booed" at the end of the concert at Covent Garden in 1994. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >He said </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >it was "perfectly acceptable to voice pleasure or disapproval".</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >said: </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >"We say libel it is, but it's a very, very long way from being a grave libel. We say that he has taken offence at the piece as a whole; as far as this wrecking allegation goes, he's blown it up out of proportion." </New>
