<Verbatim PAsource="" >TWO pharmacists </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >employed by </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Boots were fined </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >after </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >a court heard how a </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >baby </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >died because they prescribed </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >20 times </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >the level of chloroform required in a dose of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >peppermint water.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Matthew Young </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >four </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >days </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >old </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >when his parents called into a branch in search of a cure for colic.</New>


<New PAsource="" >The preparation they later gave him was so strong that it caused a heart attack and subsequent brain damage. His father, Neil, 23, suffered a burn to the back of his tongue as he tried to give his baby the kiss of life.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Yesterday the pharmacists responsible for the peppermint water, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Ziad Khattab, 25, and Lisa Taylor-Lloyd, 27, pleaded guilty at Chester Crown Court </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >to supplying a defective medicine. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Mr Justice Forbes ordered not guilty verdicts to be returned on manslaughter charges.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Khattab</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, a trainee, was fined </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >£750</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, while </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Taylor-Lloyd</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, his supervisor, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >ordered to pay £1,000.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Mr </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Justice Forbes </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >told the pharmacists that both Mr Young and his girlfriend, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Collette Jackson</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, 24, of Runcorn, Cheshire, had been devastated by the premature loss of their son. </New>


<New PAsource="" >But "to a substantial extent" </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >he regarded them as fellow </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >victims </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >terrible tragedy. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >The judge added: "Nobody should be confused into thinking that the penalties imposed here are representative of the tragedy that has occurred." Miss Jackson, who is five months' pregnant with her second child, burst into tears as the pharmacists left the dock. Mr Young confirmed that the couple are pursuing a civil case against Boots.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Earlier, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Peter Hughes, QC, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >prosecuting, said that Matthew's parents had been among those consulted over the Crown's decision not to proceed with manslaughter charges. </New>
<New PAsource="" >He said that on April 29, 1998, Taylor-Lloyd gave her trainee the task of: making up Matthew's peppermint water </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"because she thought it </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >would be a </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >good experience for him".</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Such a preparation had become a rarity, said Mr Hughes, and the NHS now encouraged doctors to prescribe proprietary brands.</New> 


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Khattab </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >confused double-strength chloroform water with its concentrated form, which is 20 times stronger.</New> 


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Khattab </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >looked up the formula for peppermint water as written down in a book kept at the Boots branch at </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hallwood Health Centre, Runcorn. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >But this was so out of date that it referred to double-strength chloroform, which is no longer available.</New>


<New PAsource="" >The pharmacist, who was three months short of completing his training, was given an explanation of the required quantities by one of the dispensers, Pauline Meredith. But unknown to her, he remained confused. </New>


<New PAsource="" >A later examination of the bottle showed that by the time Matthew was given his drops the contents had separated, leaving 100 per cent chloroform at the bottom. </New>
