MYSTERY surrounds the death of top sprinter Sophia Smith, who was found face down in a pillow, an inquest heard yesterday. Sophia, 24, who ran for Britain in the 1995 World Championships relay, was being treated for a nervous breakdown in Sheffield's Nether Edge mental health unit.

The inquest in the city heard that Sophia believed she was Jesus and had to harm herself to save the world. Pathologist Dr John Clarke said: 'Really, I do not know why she died.'

The hearing continues.
