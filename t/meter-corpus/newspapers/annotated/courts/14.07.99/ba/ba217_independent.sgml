<Verbatim PAsource="" >BRITISH AIRWAYS </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday vowed to appeal after being </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >fined </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >£4.4m </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >for </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >rewarding </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >travel agents </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that sold seats </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >on BA flights at the expense of rival carriers.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >The </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >European Commission imposed the penalty </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >after </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >a two-year investigation </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >into BA's sales </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >operations, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >triggered by complaints from Virgin Atlantic.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The ruling </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >BA </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >breached </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >competition rules </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >by providing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >cash incentives to travel agents </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >marks the latest chapter in a series of "dirty tricks" allegations against </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the airline. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Brussels' decision </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >also fired a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >warning </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >shot against </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >other European airlines </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that operate similar schemes with </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >travel agents </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >across the EU.</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Richard Branson, Virgin's </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >chairman, hailed the decision as </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >vindication of </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >his long-running claims </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"that BA </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >have </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >been abusing their dominant position".</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >BA immediately announced that it would appeal against the ruling, which it branded "wrong in fact and in law". </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Dale Moss, BA's director for </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >worldwide </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >sales, said: "</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >We are disappointed and there is a sense of puzzlement. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Our commission
arrangements for travel agents are similar to those run by most major airlines."</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Karel Van Miert, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >acting </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >European commissioner </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >competition, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who imposed </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the penalty, stopped short of </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >levying </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the maximum fine of £13m for "serious" breaches of EU rules on </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >abuse of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >dominant position in the market place.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Brussels said for "at least seven years" travel agents </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >have been offered </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >extra commission payments </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for either equalling or bettering the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >previous year's sales of BA tickets. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >It added: "This makes the travel agents loyal to BA, discouraging them from selling travel agency services to other airlines, and has created an illegal barrier to airlines that wish to compete against BA."</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >BA's practices prevented UK air travellers from benefiting fully from the effects of EU efforts to liberalise air transport in Europe, Brussels </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Outlining </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >new </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >set of principles </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to govern payments to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >travel agents, Brussels said a </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >company </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >like BA should only offer </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >supplementary </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >commissions if they </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >reflected </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >extra services </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to the airline </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >provided by the agent.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Although Brussels has taken similar steps in other sectors, yesterday's decision was the first of its kind in the service industry. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Brussels sent </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >two legal warnings to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >BA</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, the second one In 1998, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >insisting the scheme was illegal, as EU law prohibits the use of restrictive contracts to reinforce a dominant market position. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >BA's response </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to the first </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >warning was </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to introduce </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a new "performance rewards scheme" - which triggered a second complaint from Virgin.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >When </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >BA </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >initially argued that it had been unfairly singled out, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Brussels </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >told the company that it was the only airline against which a direct complaint had been made. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Since then </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >BA </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >has filed its own complaints against eight </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >European airlines </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >on similar grounds.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Branson said: "The travel trade will now be free to give independent impartial advice to travellers and offer the best deals on each route without having to meet the pressures of BA's anti-competitive sales targets."</Verbatim>
