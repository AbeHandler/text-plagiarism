<Verbatim PAsource="" >British Airways was </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >fined £4m for breaching European competition rules </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >culmination </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of its latest battle with </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >arch rival Richard Branson of Virgin Atlantic.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The European commission said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >BA had illegally provided cash incentives to travel agents to steer passengers </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to buy the airlines' tickets. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >BA </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >described the decision as </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"wrong in fact and in law" </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and said </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >it would appeal.
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >This marks the start of a protracted European legal battle which could go on for years.
</New>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >This is not the first time </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >BA </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Branson </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >have been involved in a lengthy legal fight. </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >In the famous "dirty tricks" campaign it waged against </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Virgin </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >five years ago, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >BA </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was fined £600,000 and forced to pay legal costs of £1.5m.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Branson said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that yesterday's ruling would </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >mark the "death knell for BA's anti-competitive sales </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >incentives </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >arrangements and should lead to lower fares."
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The ruling </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >by the outgoing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >European competition commissioner, Karel Van Miert, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >followed </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >two complaints from Virgin.	
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >He stopped short of imposing </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >maximum fine of £l3m for "serious" breaches of EU rules </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >abusing a dominant position in the market place. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Virgin </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had accused </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >BA of offering extra commission </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >travel agents if they could demonstrate that BA's ticket sales were </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >increasing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >compared with rival carriers, particularly when selling to corporate clients.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Virgin said the incentive scheme was designed to put maximum pressure on travel agents to give preference to the largest carrier in the market. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The pressure was stepped up every year, Virgin said, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the agents </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >were </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >concerned that their commission would fall unless they maintained </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >their </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >annual sales growth target for tickets.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The commission </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >told </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >BA last year </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the scheme was illegal. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >It said it had discovered </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >that for at least seven years BA had </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >adopted the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >practice. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The commission said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the incentives were "clearly illegal" </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the practices BA had engaged in had prevented UK air travellers from benefiting fully from the effects of EU efforts to liberalise air transport in Europe. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >BA and Brussels have now sorted out a way forward to prevent the airline continuing any preferential treatment for travel agents, and the EU called on other airlines to voluntarily adopt the same standards. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >The other airlines under investigation include Air France, Lufthansa, KLM and SAS. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >BA sales director Dale Moss said: "Our commission </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >payments </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >for travel agents are similar to those run by most major airlines in Europe and across the world. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The company's policy is to give travel agents a chance to earn more commission by selling more tickets."
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Moss said: "This is normal business practice. It also means that agents can sell more cheaply to consumers if they wish. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >If BA </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >is to be </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >restricted than we look forward to the </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >EU </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >establishing a level playing field by ensuring that the rules are applied equitably to all airlines."
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Branson said: "This is a vindication of Virgin's complaints that BA has been abusing </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >its </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >dominant position. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >For a long time, BA </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >has </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >had the travel trade trapped in the bear hug </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >of its </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >monopolistic control of the British airline markets."
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >He said that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the travel trade </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >would </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >now be free to give independent advice and offer the best deals on each route without having to meet the pressures of BA's anti-competitive sales targets.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Patricia Yates, editor of Which? </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >consumer </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >magazine, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the size of the fine </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >indicated that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >BA </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >not the only dominant carrier using its marketing clout to squeeze out small carriers.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >She </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >added </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >that the EU </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >should act </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >against other European carriers.
