<Verbatim PAsource="" >RICHARD Branson </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >claimed a victory </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >in his "dirty tricks" war </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >against </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >British Airways </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >last </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >night </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >after the company </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was fined </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >£4.4</New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >million </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >by </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Brussels </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >abusing </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >its </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >dominant market position.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The European Commission </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >ruled that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >BA </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had acted wrongly by operating a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >ticket sales </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >system under which </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >travel agents </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >received </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >cash incentives </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for promoting its flights over those of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >rivals </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >such as </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Branson's Virgin Atlantic.</Verbatim>



<Verbatim PAsource="" >For at least </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the past </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >seven years British Airways had been offering

travel agents extra payments </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in return for meeting or exceeding </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >their previous year's sales of British Airways tickets, the commission </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said. </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >"This makes the agents loyal to BA, discouraging them from selling travel agency services to other airlines and has created an illegal barrier to airlines that wish to compete against BA in the UK markets for air transport."</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >British Airways </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >said that it would contest the ruling in the European Court of Justice, pointing out that of 19 similar appeals by companies, 13 had resulted either in annulment or a reduction in the fine.</New>


<New PAsource="" >The company said in a statement: "The airline believes that its business practices satisfy all the various competition rules that apply in the European Community and around the world."</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Dale Moss, director </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >sales, said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >policy </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of giving </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >travel agents </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >chance to earn more commission by selling more tickets </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >normal business practice </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and allowed </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >agents </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >sell more cheaply.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Branson </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >first lodged his complaints about </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >British Airways's sales </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >policy with </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the commission </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >in 1993. </New>
<New PAsource="" >He believes the ruling should act as an important precedent in a separate anti-trust case he has launched against </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >British Airways </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >in the United States.</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >He said: </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >"Every time we think that BA has learned a lesson, we realise they haven't, and what they did on this occasion was very unfair to the travelling public." </New>
<New PAsource="" >The commission has the power to fine firms up to 10 per cent of annual sales in a </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >market </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >where it finds </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >competition rules </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >are broken.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >EC </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >officials said yesterday they were investigating similar schemes operated by a number of other </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >airlines.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >They said that the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >commission and British Airways had </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >co-operated on working out </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a set of principles </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that would </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >"prevent BA from engaging in the type of behaviour criticised in this decision".</New>
