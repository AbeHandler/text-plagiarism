<New PAsource="" >Both sought solace in </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >alcohol. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Then they </Rewrite>

<New PAsource="" >After hearing of the two tragedies, which happened three weeks apart, a coroner spoke yesterday of the pressures young people face.</New>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >in Buckinghamshire, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Richard Hulett </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >referred to an article from the Daily Mail last month. </New>
<New PAsource="" >It said: 'At this time of year as GCSE and A-level examinations take hold, it is the fear of academic failure that finally overwhelms some desperate and lonely young people.' </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hulett </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >later heard that it was this terror, combined with a bullying </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >teacher</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, which overwhelmed </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Anthony </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a pupil at </Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >were told. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Yolanda </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >feared her academic work </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was '</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >messy and </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >disorganised'.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Her housemistress Jane Hamblett-Jahn said: </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >'She was shy and found it difficult to communicate with adults. I believe she often sought solace and confidence in a bottle.'</New>


<New PAsource="" >Staff had been concerned about Yolanda's withdrawn nature and had told her mother and a school counsellor.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Yolanda's </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >socialising led her to under-achieve </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >in all her A-level subjects </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >- art, English and history.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >'She was very able but not working hard enough and she realised she had left it a bit late. She was just starting the first part of her art A-level,' said Miss Hamblett-Jahn.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >On the night </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >of </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >her death, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >she was seen crying but refused </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to confide </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >in anyone.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Her last words were ones of concern for 16-year-old pupil Laura McDonald who was feeling ill and saw her as she went to the bathroom. In a statement Laura said: 'She told me not to drink any orange juice and to make myself a nice hot drink.' </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >A cleaner </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >found </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Yolanda's </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >a scarf. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >A post mortem examination </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >found she had consumed more than the drink-drive limit of alcohol.</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >In a statement, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >head teacher Jeremy Nichols said </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >that despite her fears </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Yolanda, of </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Quatt </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Wootton, near Bridgnorth Shropshire, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had been expected to get good results.</New>


<New PAsource="" >The court later heard how </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Anthony </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had begun to fall behind in his </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >GCSE </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >work </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and felt he was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >being humiliated by one </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >woman </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >teacher.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >A friend, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Billy-Jade Banks, 15, said: </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >'One particular science teacher picked on Anthony and made him say things in class. Anthony had problems understanding science so he had to ask the other science teacher to explain things.'</New>


<New PAsource="" >The day before his death on </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >May 6 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >he had played truant </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >because he felt unable to face his teacher after </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >not </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >doing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >his homework. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >His mother found him </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >hanging </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >loft at </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >their </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >home.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >He </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >left </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >two notes </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >saying </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he felt he had wasted </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >his time at school </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >and </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >would not </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >get the grades </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to pursue </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >a longed-for career in graphic design.</New>


<New PAsource="" >One note ended with the words: 'School is an obstacle which I just don't have the energy to overcome.'</New>


<New PAsource="" >Anthony had also consumed a small amount of alcohol.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Recording a verdict of suicide, Mr Hulett said: </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >'I have heard two cases which have a lot of similarities.</New>


<New PAsource="" >'This young man thought he was an under-achiever and he didn't feel he was able to unburden his thoughts and gave no clues about the problems in his life.</New>


<New PAsource="" >'These problems were really the same as those which beset huge numbers of 15 or 16-year-olds, but they must have grown in his mind.'</New>
