<Verbatim PAsource="" >in 1997 when they worked at Ultra Electronics in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and soon became </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >lovers.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The court </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >heard that </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Tomkins </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was a domineering man who was careless with money and was a heavy drinker. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >In February </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >last year </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Tomkins left her husband </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and moved in with her daughter </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >but </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a few </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >months later returned to </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >him because she feared losing touch with her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >children.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >On the day of the murder, scheming </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Littlebury </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >arrived at work and asked for the afternoon off to 'sort out some bicycle parts'.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The court </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >heard how </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Tomkins </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >surveyor </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >for South Oxfordshire District Council, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >returned </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >home </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >his Mazda Mx5 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >sports car </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >as usual just after 5.45pm.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Littlebury </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >knew his lover had a dental appointment and would not arrive home before the 'deed was done', </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said Mr Lawson.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Just in case, she dawdled on the way home, stopping to buy milk and a newspaper.</New>


<New PAsource="" >The court heard it was a rainy, windy and dark evening. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Littlebury </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was dressed in a dark overcoat under which he concealed the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >gun he had bought three days </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >earlier </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >for £300.</New>


<New PAsource="" >He later described to police how he had tucked the weapon under his left shoulder and down across his body so it did not stick out.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Neighbours described hearing a sound like a football hitting a front door which prompted them to rush outside.</New>


<New PAsource="" >A post-mortem examination revealed a head injury which could have been caused by Littlebury striking </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Tomkins </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >with the butt of the shotgun. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Horrified neighbours found a bloodied </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Tomkins </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >sprawled by the side of his </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >sports car. </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >He was alive but died on the way to hospital.</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >When </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Tomkins confessed, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >she told </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >police </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >she picked up on the fact that </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Littlebury </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was thinking of something sinister.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >In </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >interviews </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >she said: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >I understood he was going to kill him and I did nothing.</New>


<New PAsource="" >'I found myself actively giving him information, the time he would be there, his car registration, his comings and goings. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'I </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >actively </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >gave Adrian Information. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >I did nothing to stop him. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >I didn't love </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >him </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >(David) as a man any more. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >I didn't have the guts so walk away </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >I saw it as the only way, in David's death, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >I would ever be free.'</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Just as a jury was due to be sworn in, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Littlebury admitted murder, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Tomkins admitted soliciting </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >murder </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a murder </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >charge against her was ordered to lie on file.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Angela Rafferty, defending </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Tomkins</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, said: 'This woman felt herself torn between two men. </New>
<New PAsource="" >She was a good woman - caught between a good man and a man who wanted her. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Tomkins </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >made it plain that if she didn't stay with him she would lose her children.'</New>


<New PAsource="" >The lawyer said </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Tomkins </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had been beset by tragedy including four breast cancer operations and the death of her father.</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Sentencing, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Justice Blofeld </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >said the pair had let their fantasies run away with them.</New>


<New PAsource="" >'It may have started almost as a fantasy', he said. 'If it did, it should have ended there, but you dwelt on it and the fantasy became reality.'</New>


<New PAsource="" >To </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Tomkins</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, he said: 'As a result of your actions, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Tomkins</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, who may have had his faults, has now lost his life. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Your two children have had to cope with the emotional pressures of that which border on the intolerable.</New>


<New PAsource="" >'You played your part by giving information deliberately to </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Littlebury </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >so he knew what to do.' </New>
<New PAsource="" >He told </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Littlebury</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >: 'In your anxiety to keep hold of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Tomkins </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >you got to the stage where you cared not at all for the fate of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Tomkins</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >.'</New>


<New PAsource="" >Anthony Evans, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >QC </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >for </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Littlebury</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, said it took a great deal of courage for him to admit what he had done, but he did it so </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Tomkins </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >would no longer face a charge of murder.</New>


<New PAsource="" >'Even during their time in custody they are still devoted to each other,' he added.</New>
