<Verbatim PAsource="" >A businessman who executed his lover's husband with her knowledge by shooting him in the back with a shotgun was jailed for life at Reading crown court yesterday.

Adrian Littlebury, 54, admitted murdering David Tomkins, 51, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >surveyor, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in the quiet Buckinghamshire village of Lacey Green last October.

His lover, 49-year-old Penelope Tomkins, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >admitted soliciting her husband's murder and was jailed for </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >31/2 </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >years.

In a letter to her lover after the murder she wrote: </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I am as guilty as you are; </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >my love for you goes beyond this life. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >God forgive us both."
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Passing sentence Mr Justice Blofeld said: </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"It remains a complete mystery why the two of you, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a mature man and a mature woman, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >both of positively good character, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >should have allowed yourselves to get involved in this matter."

The court was told that Littlebury, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >who had become infatuated during his two year relationship, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >had waited for his victim to return from work </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >before </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >shooting him </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >as he stepped out of his </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >car </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to enter the family home on October 27.

The shotgun was bought three days before the killing. The court heard that Littlebury had enrolled in clay pigeon shooting classes in the months before the murder to learn how to </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >use a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >weapon.

Minutes after the shooting Mrs Tomkins arrived at the house to find her husband
fatally wounded lying in the street. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The court was told she cradled him in her arms saying: "I love you, I love you."

The day after the murder the couple, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >who had been married for 28 years and had two children, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >were due to complete the purchase of a new home.

Michael Lawson QC, prosecuting, said the lovers started their relationship when they both worked at Ultra Electronics in High Wycombe.

"In the summer and autumn of 1997 the bonds of their difficulties brought them closer together until the relationship became intimate. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >This continued until the date of the killing".
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Littlebury, of Hayes, Middlesex, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >who was single, was said to have become increasingly obsessed with his lover during their relationship.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >In February of 1998, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the court was told, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Tomkins left her husband, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >but returned to the family home four months later. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Not out of love for her husband, but to recreate the family unit in an attempt not to lose the love of her children," </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Lawson said.
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >After </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the murder </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Littlebury admitted </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >it </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to the police. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I knew deep down our relationship would never end. I knew wherever she was, she would come back to me," </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >he told </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >detectives.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >In police interviews Mrs Tomkins confessed to her role, telling detectives: </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I gave Adrian information and he gave me information about what he intended to do. I did nothing to stop him. I wanted to be free.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I didn't love David any more. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >I didn't have the strength of character or guts to walk away. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >I saw David's death as the only way I would ever be free."
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >She said she had confessed as her conscience was eating her away so she could hardly breathe.
