<Verbatim PAsource="" >names of 33 informants for the London-based Adams family in return for £1,000. </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The jury was told that Herbert, 31, was in debt and forced to moonlight as a nightclub bouncer in addition to his £14,000-a-year post at the CPS headquarters at Ludgate Hill, in Central London.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >He was taken on at Options nightclub by Kevin Sumer, who once worked in a club run by the Adams </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Temple claimed.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >He said Sumer soon learned, through Herbert's bragging, that he worked for the central casework division of the CPS dealing with me of the biggest criminals in Britain. Mr Temple said Herbert, of Twickenham, </Verbatim>
