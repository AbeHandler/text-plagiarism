<Verbatim PAsource="" >Lim </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >at a hotel </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >and was handed an envelope containing £1,500.</New>


<New PAsource="" >The Sun described the trip when we lifted the lid on Grob's alleged role as a match-fixer in a series of 1994 exclusives. Grobbelaar's QC Richard Hartley asked him: "In court pleadings, did you deny making this Journey? Did you lie?"</New>


<New PAsource="" >The player replied: "I told a lie because I did not want the team that I was with, Southampton, to know that I would ever do some thing like that.</New>


<New PAsource="" >"I was protecting my reputation.</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >He said the cash was for providing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >information </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >on players and teams. </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >He explained the lie, saying: "I was worried about my future football career.</New>

<New PAsource="" >and that is whyI said I never knew Mr Lim." The star was later fined £10,000 by the FA.</New>


<New PAsource="" >But he insisted The Sun's claims that he took bribes to throw games were false - even though we secretly videoed him plotting a match-rigging scam.</New>


<New PAsource="" >He told the London jury of seven men and five women </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that he was bluffing so he could later expose the former pal who put the crooked deal to him.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >The player said: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I was trying to get information out of him - I can see that it was the worst decision of my life to go out on my own."</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >He </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >claimed: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Everything on the tape is a complete lie."</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >a </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >£2,000 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >bung. He said it was to gain his former associate's </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >confidence </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and to use as </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >evidence</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >.</Rewrite>


<New PAsource="" >The jury was shown extracts of five matches mentioned in the Sun's tapes. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Grobbelaar </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >- </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >cleared of corruption after a police probe and a retrial </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >- insisted he could do nothing about the goals he let in.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Asked about the £20,000 he kept in his sock drawer, Grob admitted some of it came from Lim. He said it was not for rigging games but forecasting match results. The Sun's QC </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >George Carmen </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >branded him </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >"</Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >immoral</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >" </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >and a "liar."</New>


<New PAsource="" >During fierce cross-examination. Mr Carman </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Mr Grobbelaar, the position is you are the kind of man who unfortunately will lie and lie and lie if it suits your own convenience - either to save your skin or to obtain money."</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >The QC went on: "You are sufficiently immoral that you were prepared in the High Court action to present a false case to the High Court and to your opponents, The Sun newspaper. Only as a result of the police investigation and the police evidence, you were forced to change your story wnicn you did in a later amendment. Do you understand what I am saying?" Grobbelaar "That is your explanation."</New>


<New PAsource="" >Mr Carman: "You are a man prepared to change your story to suit circumstances when revealed against you?"</New>


<New PAsource="" >Grobbelaar: "Circumstances can change because you can forget a lot of things. I can't say what I did a year ago."</New>


<New PAsource="" >The Sun is fighting his libel claim. </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >The case continues.</Rewrite>
