<Rewrite PAsource="" >took to the witness box at the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >high court </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday, in his libel action against </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Sun </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >andits former editor, to declare </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >that his lone bid to trap an associate who wanted to involve him in match-fixing was 'the worst decision of my life'.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The 41-year-old said that he allowed </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >his </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >former business partner, Chris Vincent, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >talk to him about "throwing" matches when they met at a hotel in October 1994 in an effort to get information he could take to the authorities. Mr Vincent had first made the suggestion the previous month when Mr Grobbelaar agreed to meet to find out what had happened to his investment in an unsuccessful games parks venture.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Chris Vincent came out with a bolt of lightning," he told Mr Justice Gray and the jury.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The sportsman said Mr Vincent said he had met two men at Chester races who wanted to know if he was willing to throw games.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I told him he was bloody stupid - that nobody could ever do that. I was shocked".</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Grobbelaar said that Mr Vincent said it would be an easy way to get back the money he had invested. "I was flabbergasted. I thought about it again and thought 'What is he up to?' Because in the past he had used my name to get money off other people."</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >He said Mr Vincent rang him in October and again raised the possibility of throwing games as they played snooker.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I said 'Maybe' because I wanted to know what he was talking about and who he was talking with?</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >He added: "I was trying to get information out of him. I can see that it was the worst decision of my life to go out on my own."</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I thought I could handle it by myself."</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Grobbelaar is suing the Sun and its former editor, Stuart Higgins, for libel over a series of "match-fixing" articles which appeared in November 1994.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >These claimed that he took £40,000 to make sure Liverpool lost to Newcastle the pre vious year and had blown his chance of thousands more in agame against Manchester United by accidentally making a sensational save.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The newspaper denies libel and is set to argue justification and qualified privilege during the month-long hearing.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mr </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Grobbelaar was questioned by his counsel, Richard Hartley QC, about a conversation in Mr Vincent's hotel bedroom, which unknown to the goalkeeper was being video taped by the Sun.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Counsel asked him why he had made remarks during that conversation about throwing football matches.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mr </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Grobbelaar </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >answered; </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I made those remarks to try and get Mr Vincent's confidence. I needed to get his confidence to find out who he was working with."</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >But there was "no truth" in anything he had said to Mr Vincent.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >The case continues.</Rewrite>
