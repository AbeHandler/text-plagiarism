<Verbatim PAsource="" >THE FORMER Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar told </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a jury yesterday how he "bragged" of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >throwing matches in an effort to </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >expose a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >business partner </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >as the leader of a syndicate fixing matches.
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >But the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >High Court in London </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >heard that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Grobbelaar's </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >attempt to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >trap </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >his former </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >associate, Chris Vincent, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >backfired into </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the "worst decision of my life". </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Grobbelaar said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >he listened to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Vincent talk </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >throwing matches </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to try to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >get information he could take to the authorities.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The 41-year-old </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was giving evidence in his </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >libel </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >case bought against </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The Sun and its former editor Stuart Higgins over articles </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >appeared in November 1994, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >claiming </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he took £40,000 to make sure Liverpool lost to Newcastle </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >United </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in 1993 </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >and hadblown his chance of thousands more in a game against Manchester United by accidentally making a sensational save.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The newspaper denies libel and </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >will </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >argue justification and qualified privilege during the month-long hearing.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Grobbelaar </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said he had met Mr Vincent to discuss an </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >investment in an unsuccessful games park venture </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >when Mr </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Vincent "came out with a bolt of lightning". </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Vincent had met two men who wanted to know if </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mr Grobbelaar </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was willing to throw games.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I told him he was bloody stupid - that nobody could ever do that. I was shocked." Mr Grobbelaar </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >told the jury. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I was flabbergasted. I thought about it again and thought, "Why is he doing this. What is he up to?"
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Grobbelaar </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said he had resolved to try to play along with Mr Vincent to expose his contacts. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >He added: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I didn't tell anyone. I thought I could handle it by myself"
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Grobbelaar said that he shrugged his shoulders and replied "maybe" to Mr Vincent's suggestions about the sums involved inmatch-fixing to "draw him out".
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >But the conversations </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in Mr Vincent's hotel room </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >were </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >being videotaped by The Sun </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and formed the basis of a series of articles alleging match fixing.
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Asked by his </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >counsel, Richard Hartley QC, why he had made remarks about throwing matches. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Grobbelaar </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said:
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I needed to get his </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >[Mr Vincent's] </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >confidence to find out who he was working with." But there was "no truth" in anything hesaid to Mr Vincent. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Everything on the tape is a complete lie," he told the jury.
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >The trial continues.
