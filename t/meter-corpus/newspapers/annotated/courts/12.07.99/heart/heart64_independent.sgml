<Rewrite PAsource="" >A </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >BRISTOL hospital </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that retained the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >hearts </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of 300 children who </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >died in complex operations </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >behaved in a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"cavalier" </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >fashion towards the parents, aninquiry was told yesterday.
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hugh Ross, chief executive of the United Bristol Healthcare Trust, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >revealed the figure for the first time yesterday </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >at the public inquiry into theBristol baby heart disaster, saying </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"surprised to learn of the scale of the problem".
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >Parents whose children died in the disaster, which led to the longest disciplinary inquiry in the history of the General Medical Council, learnt only </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in March, a week before </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the public hearings </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >began</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, that their children had been buried without their hearts. </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >Some were outraged that their consent had never been sought. </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >The hearts would have been used for </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >research </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >teaching</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >.
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Ross told the inquiry that he believed there were 179 cases of retention of hearts, lungs </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >other tissue during the period under investigation</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, from 1984 to 1995. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >But the total uncovered by the trust's </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >investigation </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >about </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >300, with some going back as far as the </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Sixties.
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >He said he did not make the 179 figure public in November, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >when he met </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Bristol Heart Children's Action Group, because he wanted to ensure the parents concerned were informed first </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >individually.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >"It would not be unfair to say that the NHS handled this issue in a somewhat cavalier manner in the distant past," </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >he said. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I think the practice has been far too slow to change and, although there was discussion over the years, the practice has not moved as fast as it might have done. Informed consent was not the order of the day, which clearly it should have been.
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >Under the present law, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >parental consent </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >is </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >not required if a coroner </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >orders </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a postmortem </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >examination but it is required </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >if a hospital </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >orders it and retains tissue </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >for research</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >.
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mr Ross was shown a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >1992 letter </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >from </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Janardan Dhasmana</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, one of the heart surgeons involved, in which </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Dhasmana admitted </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >there had been "some oversight" on his part in discussing matters with parents. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mr Dhasmana added </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >that on some occasions consent had not been </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >obtained </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >by his junior staff.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Ross said he had ordered a review of practice in Bristol, leading to new guidelines on consent.
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >The inquiry continues.
