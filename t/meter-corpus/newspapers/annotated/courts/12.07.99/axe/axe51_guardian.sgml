<Verbatim PAsource="" >A drifter who killed three friends in an "apparently motiveless" axe attack was given three life sentences </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Over 24 hours, Alan Hobbs hacked to death </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the three, who included a woman he had just made love to, then </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >calmly went to </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >visit </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >his sister. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The bodies lay undiscovered for a week. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Hobbs's admission to police that he was coming down from an </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >amphetamines </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and alcohol binge was the only clue to why he went on the killing spree, for which his </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >plea of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >guilty to murder </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >earned him </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >three life sentences at Reading crown court </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >in Berkshire </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday.</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I find these matters inexplicable. Inevitably your conduct was extremely wicked and your behaviour extremely callous," Mr Justice Blofeld </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said as he handed down sentence.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >The court was told that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"unimaginable savagery" </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >unfolded </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >on the afternoon of August 28 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >last year when </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hobbs, 32, a 'drifter' of no fixed abode, called </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >on his friend, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Gillian Harvey, 30, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >at her bedsitter home </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in Slough in Berkshire.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Miss Harvey was a volunteer worker for Age Concern who was described by friends and family as "educationally sub normal" and "trusting". </New>
<New PAsource="" >In circumstances that remain unclear </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the pair made love and then began to argue. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Hobbs hacked her to death </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >with a chisel.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Miss Harvey's </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >boyfriend, Ian Brown, 36, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >a painter and decorator who was divorced with two children, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >lived with her in the bedsitter.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >When he returned and discovered </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the carnage</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, the court heard, Hobbs </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >attacked him with an axe </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >but </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >did not kill him. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Instead he tied him up and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >kept him prisoner until the following day.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Investigators expressed astonishment that Hobbs was able to go to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >sleep in the house </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >overnight, with the woman's body a few yards away and her injured boyfriend </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >bound and gagged on the bed.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >next </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >morning he made </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mr Brown </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a cup of tea</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hobbs </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >also </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >told detectives that</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, as </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >planning to leave the flat </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >morning</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, he was confronted by the arrival of Miss Harvey's </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >former boyfriend, Peter Smith, 31, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >a rail worker who lived with his parents in Slough.</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >The court heard that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hobbs </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >struck </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >him with </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the blunt end of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >an axe </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and tied him on the bed next to Mr Brown. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >He decided </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >two should die</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >.</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >"The principal weapon was an axe found in the bedroom. This accused must have struck repeated blows to the heads of both men with all his force," </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Adrian Redgrave QC, prosecuting.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >He said that afterward </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hobbs calmly left the flat to </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >visit </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >his sister in Basingstoke, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >taking with him Mr </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Smith's Abbey National cashcard. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >The theft was his undoing.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The murders </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >went </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >undiscovered for a week, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >until families of both </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Miss Harvey and Mr Smith reported </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >them </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >missing</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Police who called at </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >her address </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >expected a routine inquiry. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >The scene they found, after noticing an intense </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >smell </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >swarms of flies</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, was described as "appalling".</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Miss Harvey had stab wounds to her back, head, neck and face. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Her skull was fractured. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Two bloodstained knives </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and a chisel </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >were found in the kitchen. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >In her bedroom, said </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Redgrave, was an axe by the bed which was heavily bloodstained. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The bodies of the two men were tied at the neck and ankles, as well as each of them having been tied with a complex series of knots. One of the bodies was also tied to a bicycle."</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Thames Valley police </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >mounted a huge search for the killer, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and were able to track down Hobbs when he </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >withdrew </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >£50O from MrSmith's' account. </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >Police believe he had tortured the pin number out of his victim. </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >He </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was arrested </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >two weeks after the killings.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Despite their intertwined romantic histories, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Miss Harvey, Mr Brown and Mr Smith </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had been the best of friends. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hobbs had known Miss Harvey for </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >several </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >years, and had met </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the boyfriends </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >on </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a couple of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >occasions</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >. </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >The police have no idea whether Hobbs was jealous of her relationships, or what had been his motive for the killings; </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >he </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >refused to undergo psychiatric analysis.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Detective Superintendent Trevor Davies, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >heading the investigation, said: </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >"This crime was absolutely atrocious. What happened within that house must have been absolutely appalling for those present. We don't know what was going on in his mind."</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Richard Benson QC, defending, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >told the court that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hobbs had always expressed remorse and dismay about what happened that day, and that he had a history of drug and substance abuse from </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >age 11.</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hobbs, wearing a yellow, red and blue kickers' sweatshirt and flanked in the dock by three prison officers, showed no emotion </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >as </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Justice Blofeld said he should serve at least 20 years in jail before being considered for parole.</Verbatim>
