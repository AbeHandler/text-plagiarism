<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Redgrave said: "They noticed a smell which became stronger the nearer they got to the house.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Looking through a window they could see swarms of flies inside, and a cat in obvious distress.</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >saw </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the carnage</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I have 29 years' experience in theforce and I have never ever been to a crime scene like this one.</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >nearby </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >beggars belief." </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mr </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Davies said the fact Hobbs had been high on drugs at the time of the killings should not be used as an excuse.</Verbatim>
