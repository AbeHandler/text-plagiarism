<Rewrite PAsource="" >that was kept in the house </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >before beingroped to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Ian.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >A police source said: "Mr Smith had managed to almost get his hands untied and escape.

When Hobbs realised what was happening he grabbed the axe and, using overarm strokes as if he was chopping wood, hacked into the pair of them.

"They were chopped to bits with approximately 15 blows to each body."</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >After the killings on the last </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >weekend </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >August </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >from a cashpoint at a supermarket.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Two </Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >after Gillian's </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >mother </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and Peter'sparents </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >reported </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >them </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >missing.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Prosecutor </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Redgrave said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that as the officers aproached </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >they noticed a </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >strong </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >smell </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >could see swarms of flies through the windows.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >He said: </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >"What must have seemed </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >routine </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >turned out for them to be a thoroughly harrowing experience."</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hobbs was arrested on September 12 after a massive hunt </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and when asked about the three murders he replied, </New>
<New PAsource="" >"Yeah, I done them, </New>
<New PAsource="" >the court was told. The prosecutor was asked by the judge, Mr Justice Blofeld, if there was any motive.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Mr Redgrave replied: "No. Following intercourse with Miss Harvey there was an argument, his resolution of which was to kill her. Why he stayed after doing that one doesn't know."

The court heard Hobbs was "whizzing" at the time as he came down from taking amphetamine.

Defence counsel Mr Richard Benson, DC, said Hobbs had given him only 'scant' reasons for the killings but that drugs and drink were the main explanation.

Mr Benson added: "He has accepted his responsibilities. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >He has a long history of drug and substance abuse </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >going back to </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >when he was 11 </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and has taken every drug imaginable." </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >The judge told </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hobbs, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who admitted the murders </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >but refused psychiatric analysis, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that he found the crimes</Rewrite> 
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"inexplicable".</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Passing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >three life </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >sentences, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Justice Blofeld </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >recommended </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he should serve at least 20 years before being considered for parole.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >He added: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Your conduct was extremely wicked. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >I take the view you are extremely dangerous and find it impossible to accept you are remorseful."

Hobbs said nothing as sentence was passed and he was led off to begin life behind bars. Tragic victimGillian first befriended him ten years ago and wrote to him while he was doing time in prison for a bungled petrol station robbery. He renewed their friendship when he was released from jail and found his girlfriend Karen King had taken up with his younger brother Paul, 22.

In letters to his sister Colleen after his arrest he revealed his pent-up feelings of hatred and frustration - and how the violence was really aimed at his ex and brother, who he felt had betrayed him behind his back.

In one he wrote: "Well, I've f***ed up big-time here. It will be throw away the key time, I will never be getting out. Yes to your question, I did do it.

"Why, I can't really say - I lost it basically, snapped.

"From day one when I got out of jail I went into instant depression and it just got worse. I knew I was going to explode sooner or later."

RELATIVES of Hobbs' victims told of their anger and heartbreak last night after he was sentenced.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Ian Brown's brother Neil, 39, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said of </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the triple killer: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'if he was a dog he would have been shot by now. He deserves nothing more and words can not describe how </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >our </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >family feel.'</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Gillian Harvey's mum Anne said: "What happened to her was dreadful and there is only one punishment. He should hang for what he did to them."

And Peter Smith's dad Roy sobbed:

"We could not have any more children and that's why he was so special to us. I feel my heart has been ripped out."

Peter had been Gillian's lover since 1991 and was unperturbed when Ian came into their lives three years later after splitting from his wife Caroline.

The three of them formed an unusual triangle in which jealousy seemed to play no part, always being seen out together in pubs in Slough.

One pal said Gillian, who had learning difficulties, was "an easy touch" but that the two men formed a protective ring round her.

A friend said: "Ian was Gillian's main partner and stayed most nights. Peter also enjoyed sex with her but there weren't any threesomes. People may see it as odd but it suited them."

Hobbs' sister Colleen, 19, told how he turned up at her home on the run after the killings - in a cheerful mood. She said: "He seemed happy and said he'd just had a 'good result'. He started buying all the newspapers and watching the news - in hindsight he was obviously keeping tabs on the hunt." Colleen claimed her brother had been turned Into a 'timebomb' after ex-his friend Karen King, 22, won a court order stopping him going near her home or seeing their four year-old son Ricki.

Karen, of Newbury, Berks, said she had lived in terror of being killed by Hobbs.

She said: "He used to beat me black and blue and once knocked me unconscious. I know what he is capable of."</New>
