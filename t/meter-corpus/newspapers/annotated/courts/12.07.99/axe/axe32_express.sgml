<Verbatim PAsource="" >Adrian Redgrave QC </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >told </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Reading Crown Court: "It is inevitable, assuming he killed the two of them at the same time, that whoever was second to be killed bothsaw and heard the killing of the first because he had tied the two of them together on a bed."</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hobbs</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, who had been befriended by </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Miss Harvey</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >He used the money to feed his drug habit.</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >The murders last August described by </Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >"almost unimaginable savagery and callousness"</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" > - were not discovered until a week later when </Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Miss Harvey had been subjected to two repeated attacks and had suffered stab wounds to her back, head, neck and face. Her skull was fractured. </Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >discovered </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in the bedroom near the bodies of the two men.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Redgrave added: "By the bed was an axe which was heavily blood-stained. The bodies of the two men were tied at the neck and ankles. One of the bodies was also tied to a bicycle in the bedroom. Both men died of severe head injuries. The principal weapon was an axe. The accused must have struck repeated blows to the heads of both men with all his force."</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hobbs was arrested after a huge police hunt. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >He told them </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he had been coming down from the effects of taking amphetamine when he killed the trio </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >had been drinking heavily.</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >he hit her with a chisel </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >He had </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >planned </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to leave </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >without  killing Mr Brown </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >but as he walked out Peter Smith arrived </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and realised what had happened. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hobbs struck him with the blunt end of the axe, tied him on the bed to Mr Brown </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >then murdered </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >them both.</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hobbs, who has refused to undergo psychiatric analysis, pleaded guilty to threecounts of murder. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Justice Blofeld </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >told him </Rewrite>
