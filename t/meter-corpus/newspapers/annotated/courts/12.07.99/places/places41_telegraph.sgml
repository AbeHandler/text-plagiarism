<Verbatim PAsource="" >A HIGH COURT judge </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >criticised the Government yesterday for misleading parents over its policy on </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >assisted places </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >as </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a mother lost a test case </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >could affect </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >up to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >1,500 pupils</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >.
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Justice Maurice Kay said it was a "sorry state of affairs" </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >David Blunkett, the Education Secretary</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, had to admit that he and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Prime Minister </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >gave </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"incorrect and unclear" </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >information to parents over the abolition of the scheme.
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >His criticism came as </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Rachel Begbie, a mother </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of four, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >lost a </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >challenge to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >keep her 11-year-old daughter </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Heather's </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >assisted place.
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >The </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >scheme</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, which </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >provides public </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >funds </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >for bright children from low-income families </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to study at </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >private schools, was abolished with effect from September 1997</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, months after Labour came to power.
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Before the election, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the party said that children with </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >places </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >at schools that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >provided education to 18 - all through schools - </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >could remain.
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >In February </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >last </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >year </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Tony Blair said that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"no child currently at private school under the scheme who has already got a place has lost out. They will be able to continue their education".
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >A month later </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Blunkett wrote to Mrs Begbie saying that undertakings given during the passage through Parliament of the Bill phasing out the assisted places scheme 'will be met'.
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >She learned later that Heather's </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >place would not be funded </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >beyond </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >primary </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >level - </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the end of </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >this </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >school year</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Last </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >October, Mr Blunkett decided not to exercise his discretion to </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >let </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Heather</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, a pupil at </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >St Faith's, the junior </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >section </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >of The Leys School, Cambridge, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >stay there.
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >At an earlier hearing, Mrs Begbie </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >accused </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the Government of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >breaking promises </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >1,500 pupils </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in Heather's position could keep their places until they were </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >18</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >.
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Yesterday the judge </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >ruled that such promises were "irrelevant" and </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Blunkett was bound by </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Government </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >policy. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >To decide otherwise would be to interfere with his statutory duty, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >he </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said.
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >He </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >added: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"It </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >is </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a sorry state of affairs when </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a Secretary of State </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >has to explain away his own letters as mistaken or unclear and a statement </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Prime Minister as an incorrect representation of policy, taken out of context."
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >He </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said that although Mr Blunkett </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had done himself </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"no credit" </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >by sending </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >letters of reassurance to Mrs Begbie</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, this </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >did not provide a legal platform for judicial review.
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Outside court, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Begbie</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, who will now go </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to the Court of Appeal</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, said she was extremely disappointed.
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >She </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said the ruling effectively </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >ended </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the hope of further funding for her daughter and five others at </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >St Faith's,
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >She hoped that the school, which was very sympathetic, might "do something to help" so the children could return next term. She said:
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >"Heather is going to be absolutely devastated. The pressure on her is unbelievable - she has not slept properly for two weeks.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >"How would any 11-year-old feel, having been moved out of the state sector for two years, to be told she has got to move when all her friends are staying on?"
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >At an earlier hearing, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Philip Engleman</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, for the Begbies, said </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >that before the election, Labour </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said it would </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >abolish assisted places but promised </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >pupils </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >With </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >places </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >through to 18 would </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >not </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >have their </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >education </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >disrupted.
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >James Clappison, Conservative education spokesman, said: "Ministers should be ashamed of themselves for failing to keep pre-election promises given to the parents of young children."
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >A Department for Education and Employment spokesman said: "The Secretary of State and ministers have clearly set out how the policy operates. The legislation provides that the Government's continuing responsibility to primary age children holding assisted places is to the end of their primary education.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >"We have always made it clear that we have referred to two phases of education: primary and secondary."
