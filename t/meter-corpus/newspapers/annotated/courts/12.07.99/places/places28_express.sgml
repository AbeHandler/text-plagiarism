<Rewrite PAsource="" >A JUDGE yesterday shamed Labour over its education policy </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Justice Maurice Kay </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >told the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >High Court </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Government </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was in a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"sorry state of affairs" </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >over broken election </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >promises </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to children.
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >His comments </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >came after a mother lost a test case to allow </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >her 11-year-old daughter </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to keep </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >assisted place at </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >private school</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >.
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The High Court ruling </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >could affect </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >1,500 children who are in the junior </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >sections of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >private schools which provide education </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >through </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to the age of 18. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Save for exceptional cases, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >pupils </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >will lose their funding when they </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >finish </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >primary education</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >.
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >The </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >assisted places scheme, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >set up by the Tory Government to help </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >bright children from low-income families</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, is being phased out by Labour. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >It </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >promised </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that no child already in the scheme would suffer.
</Rewrite>

<New PAsource="" >As most of the families involved will not be able to afford the fees, their children will have to leave the school, in some cases meaning a younger child will have to move while their older siblings can stay on.
</New>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >So far </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >340 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >letters of appeal have been sent by parents in England to the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Department of Education </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and only </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >184 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >have been upheld.
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >The test case came from </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Rachel Begbie, of Cambridge, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >daughter Heather has an assisted place at St Faith's, the junior </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >section </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >of The Leys School, Cambridge</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >.
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >She accused Education Secretary David Blunkett, of breaking promises </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >made before and after the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >election that </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >children </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in her daughter's position </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >could </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >keep their assisted places until the age of 18</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >. 
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >At the London hearing the judge, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >although critical of Labour, ruled that any promises which might have been made were not legally binding. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >He </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said Mr Blunkett was entitled to adopt a policy of withdrawing assisted places funding for children at the "natural break" between their primary and secondary education, even at private "through schools" which provided education up to 18.</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >He </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >agreed with Mr Blunkett's lawyers that pre-election promises are irrelevant and a Secretary of State was not bound by what was said by himself or others in opposition".</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" > 
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Though </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >it was a sorry state of affairs, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >he continued, that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Blunkett 'has to explain away  his own letters as mistaken and  unclear and a statement by the Prime Minister as an incorrect representation Of policy, taken out of context".</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Heather's education was in difficulties when she attended a failing State primary. In 1997 she won a place at St Faith's, with the expectation that she would continue her "all through" education there until she was 18.</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Philip Engelman, for the </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Begbie </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >family, told the judge that before the May 1997 election,  Labour announced plans to abolish assisted places </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >while promising </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >not to disrupt the education of pupils who already had </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >place. 
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >A Party official </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was said to have </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >told the mother of another child with an assisted place that, where a pupil had an offer of a place for September 1997 at an "all through" school, that place would be honoured through to the age of 18 if Labour was elected. The scheme was abolished from September 1997 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and, the following </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >February Mr Blair said that "no child currently at private school under the scheme who has already got a place has lost out. They will be able to continue their education."</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Education Secretary David Blunkett wrote to </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >one </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >grandparent in March 1998 stating that where there had been "a clear promise" of a place at an "all through" school. "We have agreed to honour that promise".</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Blunkett also wrote to Mrs Begbie saying undertakings given during the passage through Parliament of the Bill phasing out the scheme "will be met". </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >But </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >she </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was then told her daughter's place would not be funded after the end of the current school year.</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Engelman argued that </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >decision was "irrational and unreasonable" and breached European human rights.</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Neil Garnham, for the Department for Education, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Government had been following a lawful policy, as set out in a September 1997 letter, and there had been no unfairness.</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >The judge </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said the letters sent to Mrs Begbie "do the Secretary of State no credit".</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The Government </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >abolished </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the scheme </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >release £lOOmillion to reduce class sizes for all five, six and seven-year-olds in State primary schools to a maximum of 30.</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Tory </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >education spokesman James Clappison said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >last night:
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Ministers should be ashamed of themselves for failing to keep pre-election promises given to the parents of these children."</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >
