<Verbatim PAsource="" >A HIGH Court judge yesterday </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >condemned the Government for misleading parents about its </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >policy </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >on </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >assisted places </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >promises before </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and after the general </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >election</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >.
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Justice Maurice Kay ruled that David Blunkett, the Education Secretary</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, had done himself </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"no credit" </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >handling of the Assisted Places Scheme, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >which </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was abolished </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >1997</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >But he dismissed a legal challenge brought by a mother whose daughter's place came to an end in the middle of her education.
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >In a test case that could affect 1,500 children, the court had been told that ministers, including the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Prime Minister</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, had given misleading assurances that all children with existing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >assisted places </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >would be protected when the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >scheme </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was phased out.
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >"It </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >is </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a sorry state of affairs when </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a Secretary of State </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >has to explain away his own letters as mistaken or unclear and a statement of the Prime Minister as an incorrect representation of policy, taken out of context" Mr Justice Kay ruled </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >High Court yesterday.
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >"However, the question I have to consider is whether this first ground of challenge is sound in law. In my judgement it is not." </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >The judge </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >ruled that, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >whatever the previous assurances, the Government was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >bound </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to act according to its own final </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >policy.
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >At an earlier hearing, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >court </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was told that </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >11-year-old </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Heather </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Begbie had been struggling at a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >failing state primary </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >school </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >and later flourished when transferred to one of Cambridge's top private schools. </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >She was offered </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >an assisted place at St Faith's school </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in February 1997 with the expectation that she would go on to attend the senior school, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The Leys</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, until 18.
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >When the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Labour Party</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, in its </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >pre-election </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >manifesto, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >announced plans to abolish the Assisted Places Scheme it promised </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to protect children </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >who already had places. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >After the election, Mr Blair said: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"No child currently at private school under the scheme who has already got a place has lost out. They will be able to continue their education."
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Last </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >March, Mr Blunkett wrote to Mrs Begbie saying </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >those assurances would </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >be met</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Similar assurances were given to other parents.
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >However, while the Government made specific recommendations to protect children already at primary school or already at secondary school, those in "all-through" schools were only allowed to keep their assisted places on a discretionary basis.
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >In Heather's case, her application for assistance to the age of 18 was turned down last </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >October </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >mother </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >then launched a legal challenge.
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >The Government countered Mrs Begbie's claim saying it had followed </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >lawful policy, and there had been no illegality, irrationality or unfairness.
