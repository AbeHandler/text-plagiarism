<Verbatim PAsource="" >TONY BLAIR </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >David Blunkett </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >were criticised by </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a High Court Judge </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday for misleading parents over the effect of scrapping </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >assisted places </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >bright pupils </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >private schools</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Justice Maurice Kay </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >expressed deep unease at the Government's handling of the issue after hearing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a case </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >brought by a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >mother </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >whose </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >daughter </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >aged </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >11 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >has seen her hopes of a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >place </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >dashed.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >In </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a test case </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for around </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >1,500 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >families, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Rachel Begbie </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >argued that she and her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >daughter Heather </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >were entitled to rely on </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >promises </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >from </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Labour</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, both before and after the General </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Election</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >children </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who had </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >assisted places </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in independent </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >primary </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >schools would continue to get help until the end of their </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >education</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Once in power, however, Ministers made clear that such help would end when </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >children </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >left the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >school </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >they currently attended, which would be at </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >11 for most primary school </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >pupils. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Rejecting the family's challenge, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Justice Kay ruled that </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Ministers </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >were not legally </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >bound by their </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >promises</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >But he gave the Begbies leave to appeal.</Rewrite>


<New PAsource="" >Then he delivered a damning verdict on the conduct of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Education Secretary</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, who </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >sent letters of reassurance </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to a number of families, and the Premier, who wrote </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in February </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >last </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >year: 'No child currently at private school under the scheme or who has already got a place has lost out. They will be able to continue their education.'</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >The judge </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said it was 'a sorry state of affairs' when Mr Blunkett 'has to explain away his own letters as mistaken and unclear and a statement by the Prime Minister as an incorrect representation of policy, taken out of context.'</Verbatim>



<New PAsource="" >He added that he could 'well understand' the fury of the Begbies and other parents, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mrs </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Begbie's </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >daughter attends the fee-paying </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >St Faith's </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Primary </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >School </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Cambridge</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >.</New>


<New PAsource="" >She had hoped to be able to move up to its sister school, The Leys, in September, but has been told she will no longer be entitled to help with her fees. </New>
<New PAsource="" >The family, who have three other children, cannot afford to meet the school bills.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Mrs Begbie said after the hearing that Heather was an exceptionally able pupil but had done poorly at her local state primary school.</New>


<New PAsource="" >She had lacked confidence in her ability but blossomed in the more structured atmosphere of a private school.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Now the family feared her education would suffer and she could be bullied once she was back in the state sector. Mrs Begbie added: 'We are not against state education but I know that leaving the private system will undermine her confidence.</New>


<New PAsource="" >'I would not have moved her If I had known her place would be only for two years.'</New>


<New PAsource="" >Heather said: 'I will be really sad If we lose our appeal because
I am making really good progress.' The judge's comments were seized on by Tories as a clear example of Labour failing to fulfil promises to voters.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Spokesman James Clappison </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >said: 'The Government's conduct in this affair is shameful. They may not have a legal duty to honour pre-election promises but they certainly have a moral duty.' But Downing Street rejected claims that Mr Blair or any Ministers misled parents.</New>


<New PAsource="" >An aide said: 'There was no lack of clarity about our policy,</New>


<New PAsource="" >'We made it quite clear that the policy applied to each phase of education but there was provision for parents to appeal.</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >The Department for Education and Employment </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >it </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >had </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >so far </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >granted 184 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >340 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >appeals </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >for </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >special </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >discretion </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >from parents of children who had reached 11.</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The assisted places scheme </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was scrapped in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >September 1997</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >move </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Ministers said </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >would </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >free </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >£1O0 million to reduce class sizes in state </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >primaries.</Rewrite>


<New PAsource="" >The Independent Schools Council last night urged Mr Blunkett to let children keep assisted places when they move up from primary schools.</New>


<New PAsource="" >It said: 'This judgment shows the Government should accept a clear obligation to help as many families as possible.'</New>
