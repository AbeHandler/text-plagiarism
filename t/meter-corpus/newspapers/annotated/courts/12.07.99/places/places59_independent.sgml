<Rewrite PAsource="" >A SENIOR judge criticised the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Government </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >after it </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was accused </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >breaking </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >its pledge to help </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >children </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >on </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >assisted places at private schools.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Justice Maurice Kay </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said Tony Blair had made an </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"incorrect representation of policy" </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >by saying places were safe up to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the age of l8</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >He said it was a "sorry state of affairs" when </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >David Blunkett</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, had </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to explain his own letters as </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >being </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >unclear and a statement by the Prime Minister as incorrect.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >comments </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >came </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >after </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Rachel Begbie, of Cambridge, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >brought a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >test case </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >High Court </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >challenging </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the legality </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >phasing out funding for children </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >on </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >assisted places </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >at </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >private schools</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, expected to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >affect 1,500 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >children.
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >She argued that the Government's </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >policy </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was illegal as it broke </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >promises </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >before and after the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >election that pupils </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >such as her 11-year-old daughter, Heather </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >would keep their assisted places </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in secondary school. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Heather has an assisted place at the junior part of The Leys School.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Philip Engelman, appearing for the family, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >that </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >although </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Labour Party, before the 1997 election, announced plans to abolish the scheme, Mr Blair promised not to disrupt the education of </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >children </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >who already had places</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >He said </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Blunkett </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had written to parents promising that the undertaking would be honoured, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >but Mrs Begbie was </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >later </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >told </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Heather </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >could Heather could not </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >remain at The Leys</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >.
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Neil Garnham, appearing for the Department for Education and Employment (DFEE), </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Government had been following a lawful policy as set out in a September 1997 letter, and </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >added that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >there had been no illegality; irrationality or unfairness.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Justice Kay said that although the letters of reassurance "do the Secretary of State no credit" they did not provide a legal platform for a successful application for judicial review.
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >He </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >agreed with Mr Blunkett's lawyers that "pre-election promises are irrelevant" and </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a secretary of state was "not bound by what was said by himself or others in opposition". </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >A secretary of state was also "entitled to change policy," ruled the judge.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >But Justice Kay </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >added: "[It is] </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a sorry state of affairs when Mr Blunkett has to explain away his own letters as mistaken and unclear and a statement by the Prime Minister as an incorrect representation of policy, taken out of context".
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Begbie was given </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >leave to appeal.
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >James Clappison, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Conservative education spokesman, said: "Ministers should be ashamed of themselves for failing to keep the pre-election promises given to the parents of these young children."
