<Verbatim PAsource="" >At an earlier hearing before Kendal magistrates, John Drummond, 32, had been found guilty of 46 charges relating to his job on Lord Cavendish </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of Furness's </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Holker Hall estate in Cumbria.</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sentencing Drummond</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, who denied the charges, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Peter Ward</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >stipendiary magistrate, said that because of the </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >cruelty </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >of the killings he had no choice but to impose a jail sentence. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Drummond was jailed for three months concur rently on each of six charges of wilfully killing, taking and mistreating badgers. The charges related to two dead badgers and one live badger found on the 14,000-acre estate.</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Ward said: "It is obvious the badgers must have suffered a great deal. One dragged a snare and hanged it self and the other died when the snare, which actslike cheese wire, cut through the skin of its neck.</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I can see no reason for committing these offences because it did not seem there was any threat to the estate."</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The court had </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >been told that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >two dead badgers caught in illegal snares were found last April 20, yards from Drummond's home on the estate at Cark-in-Cartmel.</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >One badger had suffered a particularly appalling death after dragging the snarealong until it hanged itself over a lime escarpment.</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Guy James</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, for the prosecution, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the RSPCA had been contacted about the es tate by Harry Stables</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >member </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >South Lakes Badger Group. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >While searching the estate </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the RSPCA had </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >also found a live badger caught in a snare - itwas released back into the wild after treatment - and dozens of skulls and carcasses of badgers. The RSCPA had found 20 self-locking snares on the estate.</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >

<Verbatim PAsource="" >David Williams</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, for the defence, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Drummond had been devastated by the conviction.</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Drummond had lost his job which he, his father, sister and bedridden mother relied </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >upon, he said.
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Williams said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Drummond would now have to retrain because his reputationwas ruined.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >A spokeswoman for the RSPCA</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, which </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >brought the case, said: "We are delighted that the court has recognised that this was an extremely serious incident and we hope it sends out a message to anyone that the killing of badgers is not acceptable."
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Dickon Knight, an agent for Holker Hall Estate, expressed shock and surprise atthe sentence.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Knight said: "Mr Drummond left by mutual agreement and we are going to be reviewing our procedures about snaring in the wood."
