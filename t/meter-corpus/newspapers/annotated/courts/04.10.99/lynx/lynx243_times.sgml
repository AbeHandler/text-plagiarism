She had vanished from her home in Stoke Poges as she took a sackful of lawn clippings to the tip. At first her death in l8in of water was regarded as a suicide but detectives subsequently noticed the similarity to the attacks carried out by </New>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >were left </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >on the file. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Paul Worsley, QC, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for the prosecution, </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >told </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Justice </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Penry-</Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Davey </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >that they thought they had enough evidence successfully to prosecute charges but, in the light of the admissions on the other offences, they had 'hesitated </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >long and hard' </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >before putting the victims through the ordeal of a court hearing. They had spoken to the victims and they had agreed to let the cases lie on the file. However, the women had asked for the opportunity to be in court when </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Barwell </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was sentenced.
</New>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >The court was offered no evidence on a further charge of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Barwell </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >attacking </Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >and a formal </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >not guilty</Verbatim> 
<Rewrite PAsource="" >verdict was recorded.</Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Barwell had apparently got away with his crimes until improvements in DNA profiling of sex attackers in the late l990s. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >In 1997 </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >police noticed a similarity between a series of offences in </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Yorkshire </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and the East Midlands, and </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >West Yorkshire's Assistant Chief Constable, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Lloyd Clarke, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >set up a joint inquiry team of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >60 officers </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >drawn from his force and those of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Nottinghamshire </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and Leicestershire where the other assaults had occurred.
</New>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mr </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Clarke </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >at the time: </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"We are dealing with someone who is cool and sadistic. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Those women he has attacked cannot forget what happened and nor will we. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >We owe it to them and all women to catch him. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >This man is a danger to women."</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >It was not until nine months later </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >that evidence from the scene of one of the attacks was linked to </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Barwell. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >DNA </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >tests </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >linked him to samples taken from the most recent attacks and further forensic tests eventually connected him to the earlier ones. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Barwell </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >will return to court today when </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Worsley </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >will outline the prosecution's case </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he will be sentenced.</Verbatim>
