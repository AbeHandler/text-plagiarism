<New PAsource="" >One had her eyes super-glued together and another almost drowned when she was thrown, bound and blindfolded, into a canal.</New>


<New PAsource="" >His string of sex attacks was temporarily halted when he was convicted of armed robbery. But even jail did not stop him Barwell raped a 23-year-old woman while on home leave.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Detectives fear he may have committed many more rapes and offences of violence both at home and across Europe where he travelled as a lorry driver.</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Wortley, Leeds, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >admitted 11 offences relating to attacks on four women. He will be sentenced today.</New>


<New PAsource="" >During the Investigation, police from three forces linked one man to five abductions. The artist's Impression they released led to 25 women coming forward as possible rape victims.</New>


<New PAsource="" >The scale of the inquiry was second only to the search for </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Yorkshire Ripper </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >in the late 1970s which led to the conviction of Peter Sutcliffe for the murders of 13 women. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Barwell was questioned about the killing of millionaire's daughter Sham warren, 26, whose body was found in a lake 12 years ago. But detectives could find no evidence linking him to the death.</New>


<New PAsource="" >One police source said: 'He is a very cruel and evil man. We will never know how many women he has raped. Maybe more victims will come forward now.'</New>


<New PAsource="" >In June 1997, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Barwell </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was branded 'Britain's most wanted sex attacker' in a hunt codenamed </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Operation Lynx. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >It was a fingerprint found at one crime scene that led to his arrest nine months later. </New>
<New PAsource="" >To his neighbours, the father-of-three seemed a quiet family man. </New>
<New PAsource="" >In reality he was a violent brute who enjoyed the power he held over his terrified victims, mainly well-dressed professional women. </New>
<New PAsource="" >The </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >first </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >offence was </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in December 1982, when a 30-year-old woman </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >abducted in Bradford </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >as she returned to her parked car. She was driven to Leeds, where she was tied-up and raped.</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Leeds General Infirmary </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >at 10pm </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and raped. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >The woman was then tied up with </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a bag over her head </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and pushed into </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a canal. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >In her terror, she managed to work her hands free and swim to safety. </New>
<New PAsource="" >At the time of the hunt she </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >told BBC's Crimewatch </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >programme: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'It was freezing cold, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >I just went under the water, then the survival instinct took over. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >I got my foot on a ledge and managed to get my chin above water freed my hands and took the bag off my face. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >When I looked up he was still standing watching me struggle In the water' </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >She added: 'Not a day goes by without me thinking about it.'</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >In 1989, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Barwell </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was jailed for 15 years for armed robbery. </New>
<New PAsource="" >He was said to be a model prisoner and, after a 'risk assessment', he was allowed to leave Sudbury open prison for two days at a time to work at the Beresford Arms Hotel In Ashbourne Derbyshire. Nothing was known about his sex crimes.</New>


<New PAsource="" >In May 1993, </New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >raped and </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >put </Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Nottingham.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >An internal investigation into the decision to allow </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Barwell </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >out on leave is thought to have backed the actions of those Involved who were 'not to know' of his history of rape.</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >His last known </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >attack </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in July, 1995, </Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >not fought back </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >and inflicted a minor wound on </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Barwell.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >One officer on the case said: 'It's amazing he didn't kill any of these women. It was probably only a matter of time before he did.'</New>


<New PAsource="" >During the two and a half years between this last known offence and his arrest Barwell may have committed more crimes.</New>


<New PAsource="" >He landed a job as a lorry driver after lying about his school qualifications. His boss Alan Golisti said he was 'clean cut and affable' but 'got involved in minor accidents and wouldn't tell us about them.' </New>
<New PAsource="" >Barwell drove to Belgium, Italy, Germany, Holland and France where he had opportunities to commit further crimes. </New>
<New PAsource="" >'As long as drivers complete deliveries in a specified time no questions are asked. A driver can pull over where and when he likes,' said Mr Golisti.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Shortly before his arrest, he was sacked after he disappeared for 12 hours on what should have been a simple three-hour delivery. </New>
<New PAsource="" >'The van had been raced so hard the engine was on its last legs. He had obviously driven halfway around the country where I will never know,' said Mr Golisti.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Barwell </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >is the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >father of </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >three </New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >three rapes </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Indecent assault, four kidnappings, one attempted murder, one serious sexual assault and one assault.</Verbatim>
