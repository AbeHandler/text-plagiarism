<New PAsource="" >snatched women drivers from car parks at knife-point. He blindfolded and gagged them, then drove them off in their cars before raping them.

The ruthless dad-of-four superglued the eyelids of one girl, tossed another bound victim into a freezing </New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Barwell </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >tried to kidnap another woman while on weekend leave four months earlier. And they believe he may also be a killer. He has already been questioned about the unsolved murder of a millionaire's daughter and is set to be grilled about other deaths.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Barwell's </New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >reign of terror </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was revealed at </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Teesside Crown Court </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >as he admitted sex attacks on four women between </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >1982 </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and 1995. </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Cops </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >think the twice-wed fiend may have claimed DOZENS more victims. And one senior detective said: 'He is an evil and dangerous man, quite without remorse and full of himself.'

"It is beyond belief that a man would go out and commit a rape while on day release from jail. He clearly thought he had the ultimate alibi - that he was in prison." </New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Barwell </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >- who used glue, rope and adhesive tape to restrain his victims - was captured after </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the biggest police manhunt since the search for the Yorkshire Ripper. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sixty officers </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >from </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >West Yorkshire, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire were involved in the hunt, codenamed Operation Lynx. At one point the rapist was dubbed The Ghoul after victims described a sunken-faced monster with dirty lank hair and stubble.

Police who released an artist's impression based on their evidence were astonished when they finally nailed </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Barwell, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >as pals regarded him as handsome and neatly dressed. A detective said: "He must have tried to make it impossible for victims to identify him."</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Barwell </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >SMILED smugly as he admitted </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >four kidnaps, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >three rapes, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >indecent assault, attempted murder, causing bodily harm anä attempting a serious sex offence.

Police agreed not to proceed with similar charges involving two more women, which </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Barwell </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was ready to contest. The move saved all his victims from the ordeal of having to give evidence.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Barwell </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was arrested 18 months ago when scientists identified him from part of a thumb print. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >DNA </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >tests then nailed him for his later </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >attacks. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >He was set to deny the earlier rapes but advances in DNA technology linked him to those crimes as well - and he threw in the towel.

Since then he has been interviewed by Buckinghamshire police over the 1987 murder of 26-year-old Shani Warren, daughter of millionaire tycoon Joseph Warren. The vivacious secretary was found drowned in 18ins of water at a Taplow lake after being gagged and tied up with rope an battery jump leads.

The knots on the bindings were similar to those used by </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Barwell </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >on his victims. But he has denied any involvement in the killing.

The senior detective said: "We expect a number of other forces will want to speak to him."
