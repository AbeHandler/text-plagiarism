<Verbatim PAsource="" >AN ELDERLY man </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in a residential </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >care home died after a nurse </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >gave </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >him a </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >heavy </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >dose of morphine meant for </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >patient in the next room, a court </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was told yesterday. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >The </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >nurse </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and other staff are alleged to have tried to cover up their mistake and the victim was not taken to hospital for </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >12 hours. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >He </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >died three days later.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Teesside Crown Court was told that Maureen Usher, a state</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >-registered </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >nurse, gave Billy Brettwood, 77, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a </Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Co </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Durham.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The mistake was </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >uncovered when the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >daughter </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of the other man, </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >who was suffering from cancer, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >asked where </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >her father's </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >medication was.
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >John Milford, QC, for the prosecution, said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >instead of acting quickly to help Mr Brettwood, senior nursing staff and a GP failed to take appropriate action. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Ms </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Usher, 66, of Seaham; </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >co-defendants </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Vicky Haswell, 25, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Dr Jane Gustafsson, 48, of Seaham; and Michelle Wilson, 36, of Tunstall, Sunderland, all deny manslaughter.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Milford said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >even when Mr Brettwood was found unconscious, there was a delay as the nurses </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >discussed </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >what </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >do before an ambulance was called.

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Brettwood had been admitted to the nursing home 12 days before, after hospital </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >treatment </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >for </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >epileptic attack. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Next </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >door to him </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was a terminally ill man who required 300 milligrams of morphine </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >daily. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Two nurses should have been present, one to check the patient's name against </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the prescription, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >and the other to enter on another sheet the dose given.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Milford </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said that Ms </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Usher came into Mr Brettwood's room alone. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >She </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was said to have </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >told police </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >she had been distracted by the relatives of another patient.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The case </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >continues.
