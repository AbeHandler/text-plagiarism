<New PAsource="" >was charged over the incident, but </New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >PC's Jane Bramble, 30, Kevin Rogers, 28, Darren Fenton, 28, and Raymond Haggett, 29, pleaded not guilty to assaulting Mr Abramson causing him actual bodily harm and to affray on June 22, 1997. </Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >The officers are members of the </New>

The court heard they stopped a car in which </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Abramson </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was a passenger on </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >June 22, 1997, </Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >The </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >driver </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had allegedly </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >made an abusive gesture to the officers. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >The driver pulled into a cul-de-sac in Stratford, and was arrested without incident. The jury heard that when </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Abramson, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >who is unemployed, ran away. When he turned around he saw the officers running towards him. 
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Crispin Aylett, prosecuting </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >said that </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Abramson </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was surrounded by the four officers and </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >held on the ground </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >by PC Fenton. He was then kicked and beaten four times with a police retractable baton </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Abramson </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >told the court: "I panicked and ran out of the car. Then I stopped and turned around. I was dragged down to the floor and hit on the back of the legs three or four times. I was hit on the shoulder and kicked on the side of my leg. I was screaming in pain. They dragged me to my feet, hit me in the chest with a baton, then handcuffed me. They dragged me into the police carrier and put me on the floor with my head under a seat. Someone had their feet on the back of my legs. My trouser leg was pulled up and my sock pulled down and I was struck on the leg with a solid object. The blows were extremely hard. Someone said 'Does that hurt?' and I made out I was unconscious so that they would stop."

All four officers testified against Mr Abramson when he appeared at Stratford magistrates court in December 1997, charged with assault and threatening behaviour.

After he was acquitted, an internal police investigation began.

House-to-house inquiries uncovered two witnesses who saw the incident and described "what the prosecution suggest can only be a beating", </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the court heard.

The trial continues.</Rewrite>
