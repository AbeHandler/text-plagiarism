<New PAsource="" >A judge applied the "common sense" test </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >yesterday </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >the case </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of a </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >self-confessed hooligan </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who sought </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >damages </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for being run over and injured by a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >woman driver </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >friends </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had terrorised in a drunken spree.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Rejecting </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >his claim </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >completely, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Recorder Iain McLaren </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >said the law could not allow a person involved in such unlawful behaviour to be awarded compensation against the victim for the manner in which she reacted. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >He told </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roger Gedge, 30, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >lost a leg, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >that payment </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >damages </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >"would not accord with common sense", however serious his injuries </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >when </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the woman </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >drove </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >over </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >him to escape.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Gedge, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a New Age traveller, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >from </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Arnold, Nottingham, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >brought his action </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >against </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sarah Field, 27, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >a mother of two, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >from </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Cheltenham, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Glos. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Nottingham county court </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was told that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Gedge </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was a member of a drunken gang who waylaid </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Field's </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >car at the entrance to </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >a rock and beer </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >festival in a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Nottingham Park in </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >July </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >1994.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >While </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >his friends </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >battered 'and kicked </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the car, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >jumping on </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >its </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >bonnet, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he lay </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in front of its </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >wheels </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to stop </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Field </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >driving off. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >When she </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >did so in panic, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was dragged for about 350 yards </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >at 30-40mph. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Nigel Baker, QC, his lawyer, argued that </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Field </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had been negligent in not seeing him crawl beneath her car and had failed in her "duty of care" by not stopping when she sensed something was under the car.

Mr Baker also criticised her for failing to stop when shouted at by the men and a following motorist to do so. But in delivering his 75 minute ruling </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >yesterday, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Recorder McLaren </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >asked: 'Could she really have thought that someone would lie down, out of sight, tight up against the nearside front wheel? What the claimant did in his intoxicated state was "beyond comprehension" </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Field's </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >failure to stop the car was understandable, given </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the circumstances. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >She thought she was being chased by men who were becoming angrier and angrier and was in fear of her life. I cannot accept that she should have got out of her car amidst that thronging mass of intimidating men to check what it was that caused her to rev hard to pass over it.' The same arguments applied as she sped down the road. "In my judgment, she could not have been expected to stop until she reached a place of safety." </New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >The judge </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >dismissed suggestions that </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Field </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had overreacted to the situation. "One asks the question - what was she to think if her car was being battered by four drunken men of brutish appearance? What was their intention? How was she to know what was in their minds?"</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Recorder </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >McLaren </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >accepted that she did not see </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Gedge </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >creep under her car and that she probably thought that the dragging effects of his body were caused by an abandoned rucksack. </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >It was not a case of a driver </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >failing to take reasonable care.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Dismissing the claim, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he said: </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"One has to sympathise with any man </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >injured to the extent that this claimant was injured. But my judgment is that </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >English law provides him with no </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >remedy."</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Leave to appeal was refused. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Costs of the case, estimated at about </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >£50,000 </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >will mainly be met by legal aid with </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Field's </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >insurers, Zurich Commercial, expected to foot about 15 per cent of the total. After the hearing </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Gedge, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >who is unemployed, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >expressed his disappointment</Rewrite> 
<New PAsource="" >but declined to comment further.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Field, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >who gave evidence during the hearing but was not present for the judge's ruling, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >at </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >her Cheltenham home </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >it </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"a brilliant result". </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >She added: </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >"I have always felt </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >complete disbelief that he even </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >tried it. I could never </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >understand </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >how </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he thought he </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had grounds to </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >succeed." </Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >The whole episode, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >now five years behind her, still left her feeling </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >vulnerable, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >added </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Field. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >"It keeps on coming back to me, like déjà vu, whenever I am in crowds of people."</New>
