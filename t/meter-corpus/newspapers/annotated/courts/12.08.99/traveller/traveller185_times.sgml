<New PAsource="" >£500,000 </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >damages claim </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >by </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a New Age traveller </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >lost </Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >The </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >County Court </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Nottingham heard </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roger Gedge, 30, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had his </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >leg </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >amputated following the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >incident </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >outside a rock festival in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Wollaton Park, Nottingham, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >five years ago.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sarah Field, 27, from Cheltenham, told the court </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that as </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >she drove </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >into the site, </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >four men in combat gear surrounded her car and were so aggressive that she thought she would be killed.</New>


<New PAsource="" >She said that as one man stood on her car trying to push through the sunroof and an other was kicking the wind screen with his foot, she tried to move forward. </New>
<New PAsource="" >She had no idea that </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Gedge</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, from </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Arnold, Nottingham, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >who is known to his friends as Dodger, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had crept under her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >front </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >bumper. </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >When she heard one of the rear windows break, she feared for her life. </New>
<New PAsource="" >"I moved forward. I was aware there was an obstruction but I thought it was a bag or a dog."</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Field, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >whose then husband, Tom, was in the passenger seat, said she "put her foot on the boards" </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >drove </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >away </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >at between 30-40mph while </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Gedge's friends </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and another motorists gave chase and shouted for her to stop.</New>


<New PAsource="" >She said: "I could not hear what they were yelling. I thought they would kill us."</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Field, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >who had been looking forward to enjoying "a good night out" at the rock concert, said that after she had parked her car and ran off with </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >her husband</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, one of the gang smashed the windows with an iron bar.</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Dismissing the claim, </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >Iain </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >MacLaren, the Recorder, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said of </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >Mr Gedge's </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >behaviour: </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >'The only proper inference was that </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >either </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >it was </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >crassly stupid </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >to lie in front of the wheels or was designed to prevent Mrs Field moving on to allow </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >his colleagues </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >to more thoroughly batter her </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >car. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >What Gedge did was beyond comprehension. The conduct of the group was plainly menacing and intimidating. </New>
<New PAsource="" >I cannot accept that Mrs Field should have got out of the car amid the thronging mass of men... </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Nothing that Mrs Field did could be regarded as failing to take reasonable care in the circumstances.'</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >He made an order for costs in the case, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >estimated at </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >£50,000, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >against </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Gedge </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >who is unemployed and was on legal aid. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >After the decision, Mrs Field said: "My feelings are of complete disbelief that he even </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >tried to bring this </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >case. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >I </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >can never </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >understand what grounds he thought </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >he had to </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >succeed. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >It made me feel very vulnerable."</New>


<New PAsource="" >Mrs Field said that within two hours of the incident, she was being interviewed by police who said she might face charges of manslaughter if Mr Gedge had died. "I have had this hanging over me for more than four years. It has been incredibly traumatic and is something that I will never forget. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Obviously, no one would have wished what happened to </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Gedge </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >but perhaps now in hindsight he will realise if he hadn't done something as obscene in the first place, it would never have happened."</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Field </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >said the incident had not contributed to her divorce from her husband and she hoped to continue with her "happy life" with her new partner and their two daughters, Sophie, 16 months and Seffron, who is aged four months.</New>


<New PAsource="" >But she added: "The incident is still very vivid for me and I relive the horror of it on a regular basis. I was in the car with my ex-husband at the time and we were petrified they were going to kill us. </New>
<New PAsource="" >I remember approaching them and thought at first they were friendly. But they were drunk and frightening. They were shouting and hanging on the car. We felt trapped because there was nowhere to go. When the one on the bonnet got off and I saw the road was clear ahead, I decided I had to go. I felt a bump but I thought it must have been one of their rucksacks or boots or part of they stuff they had left on the ground. I thought if we stopped they would kill us."</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Gedge, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >who said that he was unable to work because of his disability, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >afterwards </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he was "disappointed" </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to lose the case.</Rewrite>
