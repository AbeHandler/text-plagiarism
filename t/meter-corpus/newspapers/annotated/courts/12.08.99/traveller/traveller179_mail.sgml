<Rewrite PAsource="" >A JUDGE has thrown out a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >damages claim </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >from </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a New Age traveller who lost a leg in </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >an </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >incident </Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >While </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the group of </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >thugs </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >surrounded Sarah Field's </Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >saying </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Field </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >could not have been expected to check whether someone was under the car before driving away. </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >'I cannot accept that she should have got out of the car amidst the thronging mass of intimidating men to check the car,' he said. 'What was she to think when her car was being battered by four young men of such an appearance? There is overwhelming evidence that what they did would strike terror into the mind of anyone, let alone a 22-year-old woman.' </New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >The </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >bill </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for the case, which has </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >dragged on for </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >five years </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >and has been funded by legal aid, </New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >disbelief </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the case </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >brought </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to court. </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >'I still </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >cannot understand on what grounds he thought he </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >would </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >succeed,' </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >she said. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >'This has hung over me for five years and it is a relief that this chapter of my life can finally be closed.'</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >mother-of-two </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said she was </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >still affected by the attack at a music festival </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in Wollaton Park, Nottingham, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in 1994.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >'I feel vulnerable when I go out and when I am in crowds,' </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >she said. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >'I used to think that the car was my own personal domain, that I was safe there.' </New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The court </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >heard </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >how </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Field and her husband, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >who have since divorced, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >were in her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Ford Mondeo </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >when it </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was surrounded </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >by a gang of drunken travellers </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >with mohican haircuts.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The men, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >in military fatigues and combat boots, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >began pelting </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the car, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >kicking its bodywork and shouting. </Rewrite>


<New PAsource="" >'I thought they were going to kill me,' </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Field </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >told the court.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >One man even jumped </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >on the bonnet. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >In a panic, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >she drove off </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >believing the way to be clear </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >but had to mount an obstruction. </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >It was not until she stopped </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >300 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yards on that she realised </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Gedge </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was wedged in the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >rear wheel-arch. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >As a result, he had his left leg amputated and suffered serious injuries to his back, hip and right knee.

Seconds after </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Field </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >stopped one of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Gedge's </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >friends smashed her car windows and lights with an iron bar. During the hearing, Nigel Baker, QC, for Gedge, claimed Mrs Field had exaggerated her account and suggested she ought to have known someone was under the car. But, in yesterday's 75-minute ruling, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Recorder McLaren </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >dismissed this.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >'Either he was </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >being </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >crassly stupid </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >or </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he was intending to </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >prevent her from moving in order to allow </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >his colleagues </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >to batter </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the car,' </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he said. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >'What the claimant did was, in my judgment, beyond comprehension.'</New>


<New PAsource="" >Unemployed </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Gedge, 30, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >from </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Arnold, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >left court saying that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he was 'disappointed' </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >with the ruling.</Rewrite>
