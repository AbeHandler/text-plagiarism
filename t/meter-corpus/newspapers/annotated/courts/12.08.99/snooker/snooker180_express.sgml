<Rewrite PAsource="" >men and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >asked what </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >kind of </Rewrite>

<New PAsource="" >Stevie </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Lawrence Two" </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >a reference to the murdered black teenager. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >She claimed the Metropolitan Police. got "two for the price of one" when she </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >joined </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the unit because she was a "token black woman".
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >WPC </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hendricks </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had to put up </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >with </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >offensive comments about </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >women </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >language such as calling black people </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"groids", short for "negroids". </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >When officers </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in the squad </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >saw a black and white man together they called them a "salt and pepper" team.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >"If they saw a woman it would be, 'I would give her one, look at the size of her tits'," she said. "You did have a few who were the main leaders, and then you have a few that didn't participate, but they didn't stop it. Somebody had to be a victim .. I was an easy target."
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >When she complained about </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >she </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >presented a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >110-page </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >document detailing her complaints, she was told that no-one would support her.
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The 35-year-old officer, who is on sick leave, said the constant abuse meant she lost her confidence, needed counselling and her marriage broke up under the strain.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >alleged </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >attack happened as they waited to go on a drugs raid </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >last </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >September. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >She </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had been transferred from </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the TSG in 1994 after five years of </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >torment, but </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >her lawyer Lincoln Crawford said that her past came back to haunt her when the TSG team </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >arrived at her station </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >on a drugs operation.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >A group including Sgt Mark Workman had gathered in the canteen at Islington and as she walked past she said she heard him say: "There's a lot of 'dodgy' people around here" </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >- police slang for corrupt</New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >He claimed that shortly afterwards, </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >WPC </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hendricks punched, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >kicked </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >and scratched him </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >before hitting </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >him with </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >snooker cue.
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >But to cheers from the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >public gallery, she was </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >acquitted by a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >magistrate </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said she was "troubled" by the evidence of another </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >white male </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >officer </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who had backed up the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >sergeant's </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >version of events.
</Rewrite>

<New PAsource="" >WPC </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hendricks admitted punching the sergeant </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >in the face </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >after he had left her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >feeling humiliated </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >but </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >she told Horseferry Road Magistrates' Court that she acted in self-defence.
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >She said she had been so incensed by the remark that she went off to cool down. </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >When she returned, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sgt Workman, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >saw her approach </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >and said: "</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Watch out, here comes </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Stevie Lawrence Two."
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >The 5ft 7in </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >policewoman said she only punched the sergeant, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >who is five inches taller than her, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >once in self-defence </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >as she was "terrified" he was going to assault her. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >She said: </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >"I felt degraded, humiliated. He said to me 'You're dodgy, you're bad news'. I thought he was going to hit me with the snooker cue so I punched him. PC Christopher Blair came between us and pushed me back towards the snooker table. They're both a lot bigger than me and I thought I was going to be assaulted again."
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Stipendiary magistrate Eleri Rees </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >acquitted </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Miss Hendricks </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >because she said </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the prosecution </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >failed </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to prove </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >that she </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >did not act </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in self-defence.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >WPC Hendricks said later: "I am very very relieved. Hopefully the Metropolitan Police will investigate all the previous allegations I made."
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Last night, a Scotland Yard spokesman said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >no </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >complaint </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had been lodged against either </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sgt Workman </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >or </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >PC Blair, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and added that the Met sought to provide "a working environment free from any form of harassment".
