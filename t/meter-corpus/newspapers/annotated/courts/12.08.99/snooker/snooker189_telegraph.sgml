<Verbatim PAsource="" >A BLACK policewoman accused of attacking a colleague with a snooker cue was cleared </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >by a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >magistrate </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday.
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Joy Hendricks </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >found not guilty of common assault </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >on </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sgt Mark Workman, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >claimed that the 35-year-old woman officer </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >punched, scratched and hit him with a snooker cue as they waited to go on a drugs raid.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Pc Hendricks </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >told the court </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >she acted in self-defence, punching him </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >just </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >once. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >She </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said she had suffered five years of </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >racial </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >and sexual abuse </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >from </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >colleagues while </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Territorial Support Group.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Eleri Rees, stipendiary magistrate </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >at </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Horseferry Road </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >central London, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >concluded that, to decide between the conflicting </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >accounts </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Pc Hendricks </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sgt Workman, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >she needed the evidence of a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >third officer </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >present.
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >However, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >she </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"troubled" </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >by the evidence of the other witness and ruled that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the prosecution </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had not proved that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Pc Hendricks </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >did </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >not </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >act </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in self-defence.
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >In the latest case to raise the spectre of </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >racial and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >sexual discrimination in the Metropolitan Police, Pc Hendricks claimed that she had suffered </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >sustained, ill-treatment from some </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >support group officers </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >north London.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >On her first full day with </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >group, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >she said </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a colleague asked her questions about her sex life in front of male officers.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Officers on the team, based at Caledonian Road, Islington, had obscene names for black people and made lewd comments at passing women, she said. She was asked if she would go out with a white man and questioned about what underwear she wore.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >She said Sgt Workman called her "dodgy" </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >- police slang for corrupt - </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >and later "Stevie Lawrence Two" while they were waiting to carry out an operation.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Pc Hendricks, who is on sick leave, said the constant abuse meant she lost her confidence, needed counselling and her marriage broke up under the strain.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >A series of witnesses </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said she had been </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a talented officer whose only ambition was to work in the Met and serve the public.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Lisa Conneely, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a retired Pc, </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >said she was aware that Joy Hendricks had been subjected to "a barrage of sexual and racist abuse - I was absolutely shocked by how those officers were treating her".
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Pc Hendricks </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >left the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >support group in 1994 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and joined </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a vice unit based </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Islington, where </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >matters </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >improved. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >It was totally totally different there. I was given supervisory rank. </New>
<New PAsource="" >At the support group, I was treated </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >as furniture. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >There they have to have a token woman and </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a token black. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >I was </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >two for the price of one."
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >In September 1998, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >support group </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >team was sent on </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a drugs </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >operation and a group, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >including Sgt Workman, gathered in the can teen </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >at </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Islington </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >station </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >after a briefing. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >As </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >she walked past, she </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >heard him say: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"There's a lot of dodgy people around here."
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Feeling humiliated, she </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >complained </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to a senior officer </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >but </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a row ensued </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >when she met </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sgt Workman in the snooker room, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sgt Workman said she punched, scratched and hit him with a snooker cue </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >three attacks.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Outside </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >court, Pc Hendricks said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >she was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >relieved: "This is going to open a whole can of worms and, hopefully, the Met will investigate all </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >my </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >previous allegations."
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Scotland Yard said no internal disciplinary action would be taken against </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >her. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"It is hoped that Joy Hendricks will return to normal duties as soon as possible".
