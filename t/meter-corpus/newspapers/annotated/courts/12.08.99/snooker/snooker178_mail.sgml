<Rewrite PAsource="" >racial </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >and sexual abuse </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >last night </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >after a black policewoman was cleared of attacking a </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Joy Hendricks, 35, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who denied </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >common assault, said she had endured years of racist and sexual discrimination </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >from </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >colleagues.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >She claimed she </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >'</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Stephen </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Lawrence No 2'.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sergeant Mark Workman </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >PC Hendricks punched and scratched him and hit him with a snooker cue as they waited for a briefing </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >stipendary magistrate Eleri Rees said she was 'troubled' by evidence </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >given by a third police officer.
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Later </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >outside court, PC Hendricks said: 'I am very very relieved. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >I think this is obviously going to open a whole can of worms and hopefully the Metropolitan Police Service will investigate all the previous allegations I made that were Ignored.'</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >
The officer, who Is currently on sick leave, said she </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >hoped </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to return </Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >needed time </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to 'sort my head out'.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Her lawyer Lincoln Crawford, who is chairman of the Race Relations Committee of the Bar said: 'We ought to learn lessons from this. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'We have got a long way to go, notwithstanding all the efforts made post-Lawrence. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >It still shows in the lower ranks of the police that there is a long way to go.'
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The chairman of the Black Police Association, Leroy Logan, said the case highlighted how much work still had to be done to eradicate racism from the service.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >During the two-day </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >hearing, the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >court heard </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Crawford </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >told </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sgt Workman: </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >'As soon as she entered, you said, "Here comes Stephen </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Lawrence No 2</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >". </New>
<New PAsource="" >I suggest that this was you demonstrating a backlash against what you see as a Stephen Lawrence witch-hunt.'
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >But Workman </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >denied making such comments. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >PC Hendricks </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >accused of hitting Sgt Workman three </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >times </Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >once and </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had hit </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >him once </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >with her fist in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >self-defence. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >She told the court: '</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >In </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >tile TSG </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >I was </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >treated as furniture. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >You have to have a woman. </New>
<New PAsource="" >You are the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >token woman, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and you have to have a black, you are the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >token black. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >I was </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >two for the price of one.'
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The magistrate </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >took only five minutes to decide </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >there was no case for </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >PC Hendricks </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to answer, adding: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'It's not for me to make judgments about the Metropolitan Police'.
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >A force spokesman </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >later. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'It Is hoped that Joy Hendricks will return to normal duties as soon as possible.'
