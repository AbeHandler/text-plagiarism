The WPC hugged her family outside court as she said: 'There must be come soul-searching in the force now. This must not happen again. I am very happy that this has all been brought out into the open. I am pleased I have at last been believed - but this must not end here.'

<New PAsource="" >If they </New>

<New PAsource="" >They would use comments like BIF, </New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sgt Workman </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >PC Blair </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >were among a 30-strong </Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >They </Rewrite>

<New PAsource="" >
</New>

<New PAsource="" >WPC </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hendricks </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said she felt </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >angry and humiliated, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and her mind flashed back to the abuse she suffered In the TSG. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >She </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >she went to seek out a senior officer to complain. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >She walked into the snooker room, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >saw Sgt Workman, 36, with another officer and demanded an apology </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >WPC </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hendricks </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >went on: </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >When I walked in he said, 'Watch out, here's </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Stevie Lawrence Two'.</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >
</New>

<New PAsource="" >I felt degraded. Here was an officer who was a skipper, yet he had still got the front to talk to me as if he was some bully out on the street. This guy had been bullying me for years. He is a copper with a responsible job who is supposed </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to protect people like me. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >I asked him to apologise three or four times but he just told me to f*** off.

He had a snooker cue which he lifted and he looked very angry. I thought he was going to hit me so I punched him, catching him by the jaw. Another officer grabbed me by both arms and pinned me against the snooker table. I was terrified. Mark Workman came back towards me and I thought he was going to assault me again so I kicked out. I only punched him once and kicked out at him once in self-defence.

They are two big six-foot guys end I am only five foot seven. Once I kicked him I got free and ran out.</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sgt Workman </Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >kicked </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >and punched </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >He denied speaking first, insisting WPC </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hendricks </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >stormed straight up to him demanding: "What did you say?"
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >PC Blair </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >said he could not remember crucial details about the incident, but backed </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sgt Workman's </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >story. However, he said the sergeant's first words were "Hello, Joy" - contradicting </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sgt Workman's </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >account.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Magistrate Eleri Rees </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"It is not for me to make judgments about the Metropolitan Police </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >or the TSG operate or how officers treat each other. "But we have heard a great deal about Joy Hendricks' unhappy experiences with the TSG.
