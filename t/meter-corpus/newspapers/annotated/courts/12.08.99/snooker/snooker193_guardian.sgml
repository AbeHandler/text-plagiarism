<Rewrite PAsource="" >the testimony given by a second male officer, who said he witnessed the attack, and acquitted </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >PC Hendricks. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >The evidence that emerged </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >during the two-day trial </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >portrayed a culture of racism </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in the </Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >PC Hendricks, 35, </Verbatim>

</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The Met </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was badly bruised by Sir William Macpherson's inquiry into the death of Stephen Lawrence, and his conclusion that racism is institutionalised within the force. </New>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >- described by a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >former </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >colleague as </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"100% dedicated to the police service" - said outside </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >court: "I am very, very relieved. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >I think this is going to open a whole can of worms and hopefully the Metropolitan police service will investigate all the previous allegations I made that were ignored."
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >The not guilty verdict was welcomed by the Black Police Association.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >"The case highlights how much work is yet to be done in this post MacPherson era," a spokesman said.

<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >north London </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >based </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >territorial support group in 1989. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >She joined the unit because she hoped it would be an exciting career move, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >but soon found that colleagues called </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >black people obscene names.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >"</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The strain </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >caused </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >her marriage </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to break up and forced her to turn to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >counselling. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >She remains on </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >sick leave.
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >"I was with the TSG from 1989 to 1994 and there was a lot of bullying, sexual harassment, racial harassment and mickey taking. Iwas assaulted twice and had things thrown at me.

<New PAsource="" >"If they saw a white guy with a black woman, they would say words like BIF, which means 'black ignorant fucker'. </New>
<New PAsource="" >On only my second day with them </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >I was asked by one of the </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >officers if </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >I </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a boyfriend, did I go out with white guys </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >what sort of underwear did I wear."

<Verbatim PAsource="" >a vice unit </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Islington, </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >canteen. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >She confronted him later as he played </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >snooker </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >with </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >PC Christopher Blair, and demanded an apology.
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >"I felt degraded, humiliated. He said to me, 'You're dodgy, you're bad news, you know you're bad news.' </New>
<New PAsource="" >I thought he was going to hit me with the snooker cue so I punched him."
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >She </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >accused of kicking, punching and scratching him. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The court </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >heard </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sgt Workman had scratches on his neck and head, and had an epaulette ripped from his shirt.

<Rewrite PAsource="" >had looked </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >PC Blair for an objective </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >account. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"However, his account left me troubled. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >At the end of the day it's for the prosecution to make me sure that she was not acting in self-defence and it has failed to do so," she said.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >PC Hendricks' lawyer, Lincoln Crawford, who is also the chairman of the race relations committee of the Bar, said: "I think we ought to learn lessons from this. We have got a long way to go notwithstanding all the efforts made post-Lawrence."

<Verbatim PAsource="" >A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the matter would only be </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >investigated </Verbatim>
