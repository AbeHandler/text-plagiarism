<New PAsource="" >WPC </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hendricks </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was </Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >from </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the </Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >WPC </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hendricks said she acted in self-defence </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >after </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >years of abuse from colleagues </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >when she worked for </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the TSG.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >She detailed how officers on </Verbatim>

</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >She was asked if she would go out with a white man and questioned about </Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >WPC </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hendricks told the court,

<Verbatim PAsource="" >She left the TSG in 1994 and went to work </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >a vice unit-in lslington, where matters improved. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >But in September 1998, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >TSG team was deployed </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >there </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >on a drugs operation.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >A group including Sergeant Workman had gathered at Islington </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >and as she walked past, she said she heard him say: 'There's a lot of dodgy people around here,' </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >WPC </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hendricks went to complain to a senior officer, but encountered Sergeant Workman later in the snooker room, playing </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >PC Christopher Blair. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >There was </Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >she landed only one punch; Sergeant Workman said she repeatedly punched, scratched and struck him with a snooker cue.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The magistrate said: 'The reality is that only three people can say what happened in that snooker room that night.'
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Because of the difference in accounts between the two officers </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >involved, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >she was looking to the third officer for an objective view, the magistrate said. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'However, his account left me troubled.' </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hendricks </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said she was </Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >'Hopefully the Metropolitan Police will investigate all the previous allegations I made that were ignored,' </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >she said.

<Rewrite PAsource="" >The </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Yard said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >no </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >complaint </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had been made, but if one were received </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >it </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >would </Rewrite>
