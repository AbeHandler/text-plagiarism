<Verbatim PAsource="" >THE METROPOLITAN Police was thrown into a fresh race controversy </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >after a black policewoman was cleared of attacking a senior colleague with a snooker cue.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sergeant Mark Workman claimed that Constable Joy Hendricks, 35, punched, scratched and hit him with </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >cue as they waited to go on a drugs raid.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >But PC Hendricks </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >she </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >only punched him once, after suffering years of racist and sexual discrimination at the hands of her colleagues including Sgt Workman.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >She claimed that Sgt Workman and other colleagues </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in her former </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >unit, the Territorial Support Group, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >called her dodgy, "Stevie Lawrence No2" </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and publicly </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >questioned her about her sex life. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Although </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >she </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >transferred </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to a vice unit </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Islington, where </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the situation </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >improved, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >she later found herself working on an </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >operation </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >with the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >TSG, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >when the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >abuse </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >began again.
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Stipendiary magistrate Eleri Rees found PC Hendricks not guilty </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >after throwing doubt on the testimony of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >another policeman </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who had witnessed the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >incident. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Despite the large number of witnesses called by the prosecution the reality is that only three people can say what happened in that snooker room that night," she </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said.
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The magistrate said she was looking to the third officer for an objective view of what happened. "However his account left me troubled. It's for the prosecution to make me sure that she was not acting in self-defence and it has failed to do so."
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said that no internal disciplinary action would be taken against PC Hendricks. "It is hoped that Joy Hendricks will return to normal duties as soon is possible," she said. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Senior officers would discuss with her what role she would play on her return </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >from sick leave.
