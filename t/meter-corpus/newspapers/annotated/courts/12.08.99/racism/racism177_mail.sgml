<Verbatim PAsource="" >The Pearsons claimed Mr Walters </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >tended to be arrogant towards younger players in the pool room and they did not want him in the competition, although It was denied he was barred from entering.</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The Pearsons </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >will have to find the cash </New>

<New PAsource="" >in this village </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >who made our lives a misery; </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >it mustn't happen to </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >anyone </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >else. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Today's settlement is not a victory for the English. It is a victory for the majority of decent Scots people. We are absolutely delighted.'</New>
