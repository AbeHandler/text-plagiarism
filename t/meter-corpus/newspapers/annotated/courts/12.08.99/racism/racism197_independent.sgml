<Verbatim PAsource="" >AN ENGLISH couple </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >won </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >undisclosed </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >damages yesterday after claiming </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >they were </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >driven from </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >their home in a Scottish village because of their nationality.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Frank Walters, 52, and his wife, Sandra, 53, sued Colin Pearson, the </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >landlord of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Farmers Arms pub in Clarencefield, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Dumfries </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >and Galloway, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >saying that he had </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >barred </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >them </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >from the pub </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >his wife, Jacqueline, the village postmistresss, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had stopped them using </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the post office adjoining the pub.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >The couple had alleged </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >unlawful discrimination under the Race Relations Act, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a claim which </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was backed by the Commission for Racial Equality.</Verbatim> 


<Rewrite PAsource="" >The case of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Walters, who moved to Scotland from Liverpool 12 years ago, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >gained public prominence particularly because of concern that a rise of Scottish nationalism maybe fuelling anti-English racism.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The couple, now living in Longtown, Cumbria, claimed </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >they faced racial abuse and that Mr Walters was barred from the pub after an argument over a pool tournament. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >They said that he was given the cold shoulder and that on one occasion the song "Flower of Scotland" was played 16 times on the pub juke-box.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The undisclosed settlement, believed to be </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >about </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >£4,000 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the couple said, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a vindication of their complaint. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >They were also awarded their </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >costs </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >£40,000. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >However, the settlement, at Dumfries Sheriff Court, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >involved no admission of liability by the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Pearsons. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >John Lawson, solicitor for </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Pearsons, said: "Both sides have settled out of court on the basis of economic factors rather than matters of principle, or indeed nationality. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >It should be reiterated that Mr and Mrs Pearson have not admitted any liability They have not racially discriminated against anyone. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >It should also be borne in mind that the pursuers in this case were subject to heavy financial backing from the Commission for Racial Equality Mr and Mrs Pearson had to fund themselves, which was a primary consideration."</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Lawson </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >added </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >that Mr Pearson's father was English, from Birmingham, and that he had "not a molecule of anti English sentiment in his body".</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr and Mrs Walters said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >they were extremely happy with the settlement and insisted </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the issue was one of nationality </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mr </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Walters said: "It was just a small few who made our lives a misery and it mustn't happen to anybody else, that's why this case was brought. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Scottish people are the best people in the world. We have lived here for a long time and they are wonderful. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >It is just a small few." </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Walters said she and her husband wanted to move back to Scotland to enjoy their retirement.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The Commission for Racial Equality </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >also expressed its satisfaction. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Mr and Mrs Walters have found the whole case very stressful and now look forward to a quiet retirement," </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >it said.</Rewrite>
