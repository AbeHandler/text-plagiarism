<Verbatim PAsource="" >AN ENGLISH couple who </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >claim </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >they were </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >driven out of a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Scottish village by </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >racism settled their case yesterday. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >In </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >an out-of-court settlement, Frank Walters, 52 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >his wife Sandra, 53, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >who is the aunt of the pop star Gary Barlow, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >agreed to accept </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a four-figure sum, believed to be £4,000, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >from </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Colin Pearson, a publican, and </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >his </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >wife Jackie, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who will also have to meet legal </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >costs estimated at £40,000.</Verbatim> 


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr and Mrs Walters, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who were </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >backed by the Commision for Racial Equality, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had alleged that </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >they </New>
<New PAsource="" >suffered 14 months of misery in </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Clarencefield, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >overlooking the Solway Firth in Dumfries and Galloway, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >because of their </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >nationality. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >They had </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >lived in Scotland </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >for ten years "without any problems" before retiring to </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Clarencefield </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >in April 1997.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >They claimed they were forced </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to move back </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to England </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >June </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >1998 </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >when they could no longer put up with the hostility. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The couple </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >alleged </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >that they were "cold shouldered" by a small group of villagers, were verbally abused, had rubbish dumped in their garden </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and saw </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >placards </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >with the slogan </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"English Out".</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >However, the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >case </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >focused on their alleged treatment at the hands of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Pearsons, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who run the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The Farmers </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Inn and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the post office. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >In their writs to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Dumfries Sheriff Court, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >brought </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >under the Race Relations Act 1976, Mr Walters claimed </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >that because of his national origin he was not allowed to take part in </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Christmas </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >pool </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >competition </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >in the 17th-century inn </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >one </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >night </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Flower of Scotland was played 16 times.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >In February 1998 </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >received </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a letter </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >from </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Pearson's solicitors barring him from the pub. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >He claimed </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that meant that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he and his wife, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >who were both on invalidity benefit, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >were unable to use </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >attached </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >post office, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >run by </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Pearson. 32.</Verbatim> 


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Pearson, 42, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >a former trade union official who has run pubs in England </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and has an </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >English father, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >fiercely denied the allegations. </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >He claimed that he had the overwhelming backing of villagers, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >half of whom are English.</Verbatim> 


<New PAsource="" >In his written reply in court papers </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he claimed </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >that </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Walters </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was "arrogant and abrasive" with other customers and that his wife was 'uneasy' in his presence. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >He said Mr and Mrs Walters </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had gone to the local papers claiming the village was racist which had 'stirred up the local community'. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Like any responsible publican, he felt that he had to bar him to avoid future trouble, not because of his nationality,</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Yesterday's agreement was reached with </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >no </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >admission of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >liability on the part of the Pearsons, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who had been </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >accused of racial discrimination. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >They said they had made an offer because it was cheaper than defending themselves. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Outside the court </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >both sides expressed relief that the long dispute was over. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The Walters, who now </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >live </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in Longtown, Cumbria, said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >they were 'happy' with the </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >outcome, but despite the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"no liability" </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >clause continued to insist that racism was involved.</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Walters, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >who previously worked as a legal secretary, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said: "Scottish people are the </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >most wonderful </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >people in the world </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and we would love to move back here. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >It was a small few </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >that </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >made our lives a misery. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >We brought this case because it must never happen again."</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Walters, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >who is awaiting a heart operation and attended </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >court in a wheelchair</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, shook his head when asked whether he agreed that the settlement pointed to the dispute being about personalities rather than nationalities, </New>
<New PAsource="" >'That is their opinion. I think it was down to </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >nationality</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >," </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he said. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Pearson </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >insisted he was not a racist. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Asked why he had agreed to pay, he said the decision was an economic one. </New>
<New PAsource="" >He added that he wished </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr and Mrs Walters </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >well.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The Commission for Racial Equality </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >said there were two further cases of anti-English discrimination pending in Scotland.</New>
