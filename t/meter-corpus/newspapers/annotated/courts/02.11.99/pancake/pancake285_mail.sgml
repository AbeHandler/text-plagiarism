<Verbatim PAsource="" >A DISGRUNTLED Findus worker </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >spiked the firm's crispy </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >pancakes with glass, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >injuring </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >customers </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and costing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >£3.5million </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >in lost productions a court heard yesterday.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >John McKay, 61, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >carried out </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the contamination </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >because he feared he was earmarked for redundancy, it was alleged.</New>


<New PAsource="" >He secretly put glass from a smashed car window </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >into </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >cooked </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >onions </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >- one of the pancake ingredients - said </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Paul Sloan, prosecuting.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Weeks later, complaints began to flood in from </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >customers, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >some of whom </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >suffered broken teeth and </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >lacerated </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >mouths.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >It led to the withdrawal of around 24million pancakes. </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Up to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >19 handfuls of glass </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had been inserted into the pre-packed onions, ingredients in Findus's </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >minced </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >beef, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >bacon </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >and mushroom and chicken and mushroom pancakes, Newcastle Crown Court was told.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Suspicion fell on </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >McKay </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >after he was alleged to have been overheard chanting </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'Findus </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >crispy </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >pancakes are class because they are full of glass.'</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >He had been employed on weekend shifts at the plant in </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Longbenton, Newcastle </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >upon Tyne, in </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >November, 1997, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >when a redundancy package was announced. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >McKay </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had been on the payroll </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >five years</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, but feared he would go on a </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'last-in, first out' </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >basis</Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >, said Mr </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sloan.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >He was reported by fellow workers to be angry at the prospect, saying: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'I </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >will never </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >get </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >another </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >job at my age.' </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Others noticed </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >cuts </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >on </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >his fingers </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >on several occasions.</New>


<New PAsource="" >When questioned by his bosses and the police, he was the only worker to come up with a theory of how the glass might have found its way into the pancakes and was arrested a week later. </New>
<New PAsource="" >After the discovery of the glass, the weekend shift was suspended for three months on full pay and eventually discontinued with the loss of 56 jobs.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Mr </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sloan </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >said </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >McKay </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >could be the only person responsible for the glass. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >We say </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the defendant had a motive for committing </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >these </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >offences and the opportunity,' </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >he added. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'Of course, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >there are other people who had </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the motive </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >opportunity, but when you consider </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >what </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he said and did </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >there can </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >only be one conclusion - that he was </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >the person </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >responsible </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >for contaminating </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >products with </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >glass.'</Verbatim> 


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Pancakes </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >produced on five separate weekends when </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >McKay </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was on duty were tainted. </New>
<New PAsource="" >On one weekend when they were not, he had been off work sick, the jury was told.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Workers reported </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >McKay </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >spending long tea breaks away from the production line. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Asked why, he was heard to say: 'That's for me to know and you to find out.'</New>


<New PAsource="" >Mr </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sloan </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >added: 'Throughout interviews with police, he denied ever introducing the glass and denied giving the impression that be was annoyed about his impending redundancy, contrary to what was said by a number of colleagues.'</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >McKay, from Wark, Northumberland, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >denies food contamination.</New> 


<New PAsource="" >The trial continues.</New>
