<Verbatim PAsource="" >A </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >FOOD company packer who feared he might </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >be made redundant </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >added </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >glass </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >fragments to the ingredients for </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >savoury pancakes, a court heard </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday.</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >John McKay, 61, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >is alleged to have put </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >between 11 and </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >19 handfuls </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >from a shattered car window into boxes of prepacked </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >onions </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >used in the recipe.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Sixty-six people complained of finding the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >glass</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, which caused </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >broken teeth </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >cut mouths</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, after the snacks were distributed to supermarkets throughout Europe.</New>


<New PAsource="" >It caused the withdrawal of about 24 million </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Findus </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Crispy Mince Beef </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Pancakes </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >from sale at a </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >cost </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to the company of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >£3.5 million, Newcastle upon Tyne Crown Court </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >told.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >The jury heard that when the contaminated products were discovered, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mckay was heard </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to say: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Findus </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Crispy </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Pancakes are class because they are full of glass."</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >He was a weekend shift worker at the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Nestlé</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >-owned </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Findus </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >food plant in </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Longbenton</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, Newcastle, when a package of redundancies was announced in November 1997.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >McKay </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had been employed by the company for </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >five years </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and is alleged to have started contaminating the food after being told that </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >job </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >cuts </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >would be on the basis of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"last in, first out". </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >It was realised that the goods had been tampered with on five separate weekends only when the company </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >received </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >its </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >first </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >complaint on Feb </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >13 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >1998. </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >Police were called in and </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >McKay, from Wark, Northumberland, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was arrested a week later.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Paul Sloan, prosecuting, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >said </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >McKay </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >denied any knowledge of the contamination but was the only person who could have done it.</New>


<New PAsource="" >He told the jury: "The glass recovered, which amounted to between some 11 and 19 handfuls, was examined and was found to have originated from the side window of a motor vehicle."</New>


<New PAsource="" >"Customers sustained broken teeth and cuts to the mouth that led to a massive recall of pancakes and the launch of a massive investigation. It was concluded that the glass had not found its way into the pancakes accidentally but had been deliberately placed there by someone on the Longbenton site."</New>


<New PAsource="" >"The tiny cubes had gone unnoticed, hidden in batches of onions which found their way into the pancakes during production. </New>
<New PAsource="" >We say </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the defendant had a motive for committing </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >these </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >offences and had the opportunity."</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >The court heard how batches of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >pancakes </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >including minced </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >beef and onion, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >bacon and mushroom </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >and chicken and mushroom, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >were contaminated during the weekend shifts when </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >McKay </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was working at the plant.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Mr </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sloan </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >said on a weekend when the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >pancakes </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >were not contaminated, beginning Jan 31, the defendant was off work ill.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Colleagues reported that McKay would spend long tea-breaks away from the production line and when asked what he had been doing he was heard to say: "That's for me to know and you to find out."</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Sloan </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >claimed that staff heard </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >McKay </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >say on a number of occasions: "I will never get another </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >job at my age."</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >After glass was discovered in the products the weekend shift was suspended for three months on full pay and was eventually discontinued with the loss of 56 jobs.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >McKay denies five charges of </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >food </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >contamination.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >The hearing continues.</New>
