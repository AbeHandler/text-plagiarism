<New PAsource="" >Sick</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Prosecutor </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Paul Sloan </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >McKay </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was a weekend nightshift worker at the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Findus </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >food factory in </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Longbenton. Newcastle upon Tyne, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >when redundancies were announced in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >November 1997.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Three months later the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Nestlé-owned plant </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was deluged with complaints from customers who had found glass </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in minced </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >beef and chicken pancakes.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >A police probe found batches of pancakes had been contaminated with up to </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >19 handfuls of glass </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >on </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >five weekends </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >out of a six-week period. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Newcastle Crown Court </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >heard.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >McKay </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was off sick on the one weekend in that period In which pancakes were not tampered with, it was claimed. All other staff facing redundancy were at work that weekend.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Sloan </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >said: "The glass recovered was examined and was found to have originated from the side window of a motor vehicle."

"The tiny cubes had gone unnoticed, hidden in batches of onions which found their way into the pancakes during production."

"It was concluded that the glass had not found its way into the pancakes accidentally but had been deliberately placed there by someone on the Longbenton site."

Loitering

McKay's fellow workers told police that he regularly spent long tea-breaks away from the production line.

And when they questioned him about what he had been doing he allegedly replied: "That's for me to know and you to find out."</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Some staff at the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >factory, which </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >employed </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >800 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >people, said they noticed </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >cuts </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >on </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >his fingers. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >He is said to have claimed he injured his hands </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >clearing a greenhouse.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Others reported that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >McKay, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Wark, Northumberland. was </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >furious about the impending redundancies - and kept saying: </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >"I will never get another job at my age." - </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Sloan </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said: </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >"When rumours began to circulate around the factory about the contamination the weekend shift was briefed about the complaints. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >defendant </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was heard </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >to say a </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >little ditty 'Findus pancakes are class, because they are full of glass'."</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Before the contamination were discovered </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >McKay </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was also allegedly heard to say: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"If someone wanted to get back at the company, it would be easy, because the machinery does not detect glass."</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Annoyed</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Sloan </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >said that over one weekend </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >McKay </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was spotted loitering near a chilled storage area where the pancake ingredients were kept. When </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >McKay </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was formally interviewed about the sabotage by bosses he appeared totally unconcerned. It was claimed.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Sloan </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >said: "He was negative about the company. He was also the only person to come up with a theory about the contamination."

"Throughout the interviews with police he denied introducing the glass. He also denied giving the impression he was annoyed about redundancy, contrary to what was said by colleagues."

"We say </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the defendant had a motive for committing these offences </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >- </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >and he had the opportunity."</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Of course, he was not the only person with the motive or opportunity, but when you consider all he did and said, you can only draw one conclusion </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >- </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >that he was responsible for introducing the glass."</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >During the probe the factory's entire </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >weekend shift </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was suspended on full pay for three months. It was eventually discontinued permanently.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >McKay, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who worked at the plant for </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >five years, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >denies five charges </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of food contamination. 

The trial continues.</Rewrite>
