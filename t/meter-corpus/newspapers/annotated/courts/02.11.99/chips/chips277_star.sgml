<New PAsource="" >I had to sleep on a double bed. I was very fat then. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >I would wait for my parents to come back in the evening for our meal. Food was never prepared in the house. Most nights they would come home with a whole load of chips. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >I would get up in the morning and have toast, but only if my parents had bothered to buy any bread."

<Verbatim PAsource="" >said: </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"No proper food was provided </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >for him. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Instead he was regularly fed chips over and over again from a chip shop, on an almost daily basis. The only food kept in the kitchen was bread, butter and jam."</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >
</New>

<New PAsource="" >"One friend says that when she called round the only other thing in the kitchen was chip wrappers. The child had no new clothes. Meryl had a wardrobe full of designer clothes - all too small for her."

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Ferrier </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >added of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Richard: </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >"He was treated as a prisoner in his own home. He went to school, but was not allowed out to socialise. He was required to carry out household chores and, if he failed, would receive violence. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Once his father had knocked him to the floor, Meryl would join in and kick him."
