<Verbatim PAsource="" >Occasionally I </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >would eat </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >pasty and chips or jumbo sausage with chips - but mainly it was just chips."
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I would wait for my parents to come back in the evening for our meal. Most nights they would come home with chips."

<New PAsource="" >He went on: </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"My name in the house was stupid fat b*****d. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >I'd get up in the morning and have toast - but only if my parents had bothered to buy any bread. 
</New>

<New PAsource="" >"I wore dirty, secondhand clothes and did all the housework, or else I was beaten by my dad."
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >"</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >He </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >would punch me almost every day and Meryl would join in by kicking me. But I was such a fat kid I could hardly feel </Verbatim>
