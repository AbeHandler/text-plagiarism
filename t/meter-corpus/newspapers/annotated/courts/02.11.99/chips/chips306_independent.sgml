<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday that he had </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >ballooned to 22 stone </Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >jury "Occasionally I ate pasty and chips or jumbo sausage with chips - but mainly it was just chips. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >I got used to it. I would wait for my parents to come back in the evening for our meal. We would regularly live on chippy meals. Food was never prepared in the house ever. Most nights they would come home with a whole load of chips."

<Rewrite PAsource="" >the prosecution was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >offering </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >no </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >further evidence </Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >were not </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >able </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to testify </Rewrite>
