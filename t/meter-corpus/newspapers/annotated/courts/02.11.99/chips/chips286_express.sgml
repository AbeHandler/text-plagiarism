<Rewrite PAsource="" >by feeding </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >him a </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >daily </Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Richard Thomas </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >told a court he became grossly overweight after his parents gave him </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >junk food </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >every day.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Now an 18-year-old student, he gave evidence against his </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >father and stepmother </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >who were both accused of cruelty by failing to provide adequate food at their five-bedroom family home. </New>
<New PAsource="" >It is believed to be the first time a cruelty charge has related to the alleged overfeeding of a child.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >The teenager, who has slimmed to 15st since leaving home, told the jury: </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Occasionally I ate pasty and chips or jumbo sausage with chips - but mainly it was just chips. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >I got used to it. I would wait for my parents to come back in the evening for our meal. We would regularly live on chippy meals. Food was never prepared in the house, ever. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Most nights they would come home with a whole load of chips. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >I weigh 15st now but </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >I used to be 22st when I was 12. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >I had to sleep on a double bed. I was very fat then.</New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >His father, businessman Christopher Grant, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >45, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >and stepmother Meryl Grant, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >43, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >were accused of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >three counts of cruelty against </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >him. 
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Cardiff Crown Court </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >heard that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Richard </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was dressed in old, second-hand clothes </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >while his </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >stepmother </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had a wardrobe full of designer dresses.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Richard </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >told the court that his parents would hurl abuse at him for being overweight. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >He </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"My name in the house was 'stupid fat bastard'. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >I would get up in the morning and have toast but only if my parents had bothered to buy any bread. </New>
<New PAsource="" >I wore dirty, second-hand clothes, did all the housework - or else I was beaten by my dad - and then had chips for tea. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >My father would punch me almost every day and Meryl would join in by kicking me, But I was such a fat kid that I could hardly feel the kicks at all."
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Richard, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >5ft 10in, was wearing a smart blue-and-white striped shirt </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >when </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >appeared at </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >court. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >He told the jury he was often freezing in the large family home and used candles for heat and light.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Prosecutor Susan Ferrier said: "No proper food was provided. Instead he was regularly fed chips over and over again from a chip shop on an almost daily basis.</Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The only food kept in the kitchen was bread, butter and jam. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >One friend says that when she called round the only other thing in the kitchen was chip wrappers. The child had no new clothes. He wore second-hand clothes which were thrown away only when they wore out. Meryl, on the other hand, had a wardrobe full of designer clothes and dresses, all too small for her."
</New>

<New PAsource="" >"She sent all her clothes out to a laundrette and they would be sent back neatly folded."
</New>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Ms </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Ferrier </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >added: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >He was treated as a prisoner in his own home. He went to school but was not allowed out to socialise. He was required to carry out household chores and if he failed would receive violence."
</New>

<New PAsource="" >"He was referred to in derogatory terms, being called the ugly fat bastard. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Richard regularly suffered violence and once the father had knocked him to the floor Meryl would join in and kick him."
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Self-employed </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Christopher and Meryl Grant, of Sully, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in the Vale of Glamorgan, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >denied three </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >charges </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >of cruelty </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >from 1994 to 1997. </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >They were </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >charged with cruelty to a child by regular violent attacks, cruelty by failing to provide adequate food, clothing and accommodation, and by constantly referring to him in a derogatory fashion.
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >But the couple were cleared </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >after </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >one of the witnesses </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >withdrew evidence </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >due to be given in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >court. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Ms </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Ferrier said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that the prosecution was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >offering </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >no </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >further evidence.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The Grants </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >were not required to give </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >evidence in their defence </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >when the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Recorder of Cardiff Michael Gibbon QC, formally found the couple not guilty.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The Grants </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >refused </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to comment as they left the court </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >in a yellow convertible Saab.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Professor Jo Sibert, of the University of Wales School of Medicine in Cardiff, told The Express: "The average weight of a boy on his twelfth birthday is 6st 21b. </New>
<New PAsource="" >This condition in a child is known as simple obesity but in my experience obesity in children is rarely simple and not a matter of diet alone."
