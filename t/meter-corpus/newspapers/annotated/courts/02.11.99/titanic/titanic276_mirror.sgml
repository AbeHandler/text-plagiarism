<New PAsource="" >MIRROR </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >chef Marco Pierre White </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was celebrating </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >last night after his arch rival failed to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >sink </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Titanic.
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >Millionaire </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Oliver Peyton - owner of the Atlantic Bar and Grill </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >- had simmered with fury when </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Marco </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >opened his glittering art deco Titanic restaurant in the same London building.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Insisting that Marco's hot new nightspot was a carbon copy of his own trendy eaterie, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Peyton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >launched a </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >High Court </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >bid to have Marco's place closed down.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >But yesterday Peyton's lawyers told the court that they bad reached a confidential agreement and were dropping the action.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Jubilant </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Marco </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was in typically exuberant form when he spoke to me after his legal triumph.
</New>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >The king of chefs </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said: "</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >I was </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >never worried about the threat because </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >my </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >hobbies </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >are </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >hunting, fishing and litigation."
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I am a hunter by nature. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >I'm very disappointed that they abandoned the case."
</New>

<New PAsource="" >'A year ago Oliver was like a canary - he couldn't stop singing. Now he's like an ostrich with his head in the sand.'
</New>

<New PAsource="" >"This proves firstly that the man Is not particularly intelligent and has no strategy."
</New>

<New PAsource="" >"His lawyers tried to do a deal with me. I refused to have any of it. It was a sign of weakness. If you bring an action against someone then you go through with it. You don't crumble and buckle."
</New>

<New PAsource="" >"And Oliver is a man who crumbled and buckled."
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Marco also ruled out any reconciliation with Peyton. "I have never sat across the table from him and I would never want to sit across the table from him, I couldn't imagine anything worse. He had the greatest breakfast of his life this morning - he ate his own words."
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The Titanic</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, which opened 11 months ago, and the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Atlantic </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >are both in the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Regent Palace Hotel </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >just off </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Piccadilly Circus.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Peyton claimed his </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >£450,000-</New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a-year lease </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >protected him from any rival </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >business </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >being set up in such close proximity.
</Rewrite>

<New PAsource="" >He also claimed that both the exclusive restaurants had the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >same art deco </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >interior and attracted </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the same clientele.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Peyton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was ordered to pay </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Marco £200,000 </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >towards his legal bill.
