<New PAsource="" >A GOURMET </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >High Court </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >encounter, something to savour. </New>
<New PAsource="" >That had been the billing - two of London's top restauranteurs locked in a struggle that would last through many courses before anyone was satisfied.</New>


<New PAsource="" >In the end, it barely got past the starters, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and yesterday </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Marco Pierre White </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Oliver Peyton </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >settled their differences privately </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >after just one day in court.</New>


<New PAsource="" >The temperamental </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mr </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >White </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was being sued by </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Peyton, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >owner of the fashionable </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Atlantic Bar and Grill, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >who said Mr White's </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Titanic restaurant, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >which is in the same building, was a replica of his own establishment and should be closed </New>
<New PAsource="" >But </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mr </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Peyton </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >dropped his case after reaching </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a confidential agreement with </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >his </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >landlords, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >whom, he claimed, should not have allowed such direct competition to open in the first place.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Both establishments, in the former </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Regent Palace Hotel </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >near </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Piccadilly Circus</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, are decorated in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the same art deco style </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and both are keen to attract the same celebrity clientele. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The Titanic, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >which opened last December, allows hoi polloi to eat in its restaurant but the bar is for members only. </New>
<New PAsource="" >At </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Atlantic, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >there are door staff to deny entry to anyone not deemed cool enough.</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mr </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Peyton</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, who opened the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Atlantic </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >in 1994, was also suing his </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >landlords, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Posthouse Hotels and </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Forte</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, for damages claiming that such competition was not allowed under the terms of his </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >£480,000-a-year </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >lease. </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >The case was scheduled to last two weeks but, shortly before </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mr </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Peyton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was due to take the stand, the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Atlantic </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >announced it had reached an agreement with the landlords and </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >therefore abandoning </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the whole action.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >The judge, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Justice Rattee, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >said he was concerned by the way the litigation had been conducted by the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Atlantic </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and ordered it to pay higher indemnity rather than standard costs to </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Titanic, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >starting with </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >£200,000. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >He added: "Why should the defendant whose business has been put under threat have to pay any costs?"</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Charles Purle, representing the Titanic, said: "</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >The feeling on our side is that the claim against Marco Pierre White was, at least in part, motivated by vindictiveness on the part of Oliver Peyton who sees him as a rival whose presence he can do without. </New>
<New PAsource="" >My client </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >has had to put up with these proceedings </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >at a critical time when the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >business is in its infancy. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >The fact that he is the embodiment of a successful hotelier and chef is neither here nor there, the business has to justify its own existence and under the auspices of less brave </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >individuals might have crumbled at the outset."</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >He said that last November </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mr </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Peyton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had sought an injunction designed to shut down the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Titanic </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >but added that his action was misconceived given that </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mr </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Peyton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had known since January 1997 that the premises were likely to be occupied by </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mr </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >White </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and that he was likely to provide competition. </New>
<New PAsource="" >The proceedings were begun a month before the £2m </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Titanic </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >opened.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Under the terms of his lease </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mr </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Peyton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had negotiated a covenant barring the landlords from opening a competing business in the same building, with the proviso that nothing should prevent them from carrying on their trade as restauranteurs.</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >After the hearing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Atlantic and their landlords issued a joint statement </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >confirming that the case had been settled and that both sides </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"look forward to resuming a good relationship long into the future".</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mr </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >White </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >said: "I am happy with the outcome but disappointed that they abandoned their case against me because I was looking forward to a two-week vacation in court."</New>
