<New PAsource="" >THE SCENE was set last night for a dramatic </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >court </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >clash </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >next month </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >between Neil Hamilton, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the former Tory MP, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >and Mohamed Fayed, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >over </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the cash for questions </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >allegations </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >that destroyed the ex-minister's political career.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Five law lords </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >ruled unanimously that </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >could bring </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >an </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >action </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >libel against </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the chairman of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Harrods, </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >despite </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >claims </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >that this would undermine the historic privileges of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Parliament.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Their decision marked the failure of a protracted legal battle waged by </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Fayed </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and the parliamentary authorities to stop the case proceeding.</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had already won in the High Court and in the Court of Appeal. But the issue was of such </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >constitutional </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >significance that the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Law Lords </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >agreed to hear a further appeal by </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Fayed.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >The senior law lord, Lord Browne-Wilkinson, said their </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >reasons </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >for letting the case go ahead </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >would be given </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >at a later date. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >But he indicated that a change to the Defamation Act engineered by </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >when he was an </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >MP </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >to enable him to sue the Guardian had tipped the balance in his favour.

It had been argued by counsel for Mr Fayed and by Ross Cranston, Solicitor General - representing the interests of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Parliament </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >- that the 1689 Bill of Rights made it impossible for Mr Hamilton to proceed.

Article 9 provides that "the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Parliament </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Parliament"</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" > - The allegations against </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >were investigated by Sir Gordon Downey, the parliamentary standards commissioner. He upheld complaints that </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had not declared hospitality he had received. 

On the question of cash for questions, he said: "The evidence points compellingly to the conclusion that </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >accepted cash payments from </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Fayed </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >in return for lobbying services."

Since </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Parliament </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had reached a conclusion, it was argued before the law lords that the courts could not con sider the matter separately.

Michael Beloff, QC, for </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Fayed, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >said the proposed action </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >could result </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >in "a direct </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >collision between </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >the findings of the court and the findings of the parliamentary authority which cannot be entertained under our system".

But the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >law lords </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >said </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had the means to pursue the libel case by virtue of his own amendment to the 1996 defamation laws. This allowed him to waive his privilege and specifically stated that any contrary verdict reached by the court would not amount to an attack on Parliament's rights.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >who was awarded costs, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said last night: </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >"I am now looking forward to seeing </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Fayed </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >in the witness box next month. He must have spent between £500,000 and </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >£750,000 trying to stop </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >this case coming </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to court. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Now he is looking </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >down the barrel of a gun </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >my finger </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >is </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >on the trigger."</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >He added: "I am relishing the prospect of vindicating my reputation but also that of the House of Commons of
the stain which Fayed's allegations have been responsible for."
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >formerly Conservative </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >MP </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >for Tatton, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >has consistently maintained that </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >did not take </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >cash </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >from </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Fayed </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to represent his interests in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Parliament. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >He is suing over allegations </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to this effect made by </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Fayed </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in a Channel 4 </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >television documentary.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The libel action is </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >due </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to begin in the </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >High </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Court </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >on Nov 15.</Verbatim>
