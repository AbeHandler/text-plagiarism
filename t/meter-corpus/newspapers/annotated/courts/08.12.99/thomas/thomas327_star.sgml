<Verbatim PAsource="" >SHOPKEEPER Kevan Roberts was </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >jailed for life for the </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >brutal </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >murder of </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >schoolboy </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas Marshall.
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >Roberts simply nodded as the jury gave their </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >unanimous </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >guilty </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >verdict </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >after deliberating for nine hours. </New>
<New PAsource="" >And </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Justice Smedley </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >- indicating he would recommend he serve at least 10 years before possibility of parole - told him: </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"You have been found guilty of strangling a boy </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >of 12. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >You described him </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >to witnesses </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >as 'not an angel' </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >no doubt he wasn't. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Very few 12-year-old boys are. But he didn't deserve to die in the appalling way in which you treated him."
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >The self-confessed homosexual choked </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >to death at his shop in Eccles, Norfolk, and then drove </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >50 miles </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >to a layby near Thetford to dump the body.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >The prosecution said he murdered the boy because he feared he was about to tell police of their secret sexual relationship. </New>
<New PAsource="" >But Roberts - kicked out of the Royal Navy in the 70s after a gay-marriage scandal in which his jilted "bridegroom" </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >sent compromising pictures </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >of him to his </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >commanding officer </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >- blackened Thomas's character at </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Norwich Crown Court </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >with allegations that he was a </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"rent boy" and a "nuisance".
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >And, despite their relief at the verdict, Thomas's parents immediately set out to clear his name.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Librarians </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >John</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, 52, and </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Carol</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, 48, issued a statement saying nobody would recognise him from the impressions given.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >The couple, via Norfolk Police, said: "We would like to correct the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >biased </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >view of our son portrayed by the defendant and his counsel for their own ends. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"He had a stable and loving family. We did not permit him to smoke and do not believe his references to drugs were any more than adolescent bravado.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Thomas was intelligent and strong-willed. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >But, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >inquisitive by nature, be lacked the experience to deal with a situation Into which his curiosity had led him."</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >The officer </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >who led the </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >murder hunt, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Det Chief Insp Bill Goreham, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said: </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >"His parents were largely unaware of some of the things he was doing."
</New>

<New PAsource="" >But Thomas's aunt Marie Breame said: "Justice has been done on the day after what </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >would have been </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >his </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >15th birthday </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >... and </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the jailing of Roberts </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >ensures </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >can't </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >prey on other children.</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >"
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >who admitted being </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >an active gay since </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >his teens, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was outed in 1974 </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >after going </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >through a homosexual "marriage" </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >while serving with the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Navy </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >in Plymouth. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Roberts took on his partner's name, changing his surname to Hamilton by deed poll.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >His lover sent the photos that got him dismissed from the service after he ended the relationship. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had planned a career in </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Navy as a medical assistant. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >He </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >had no convictions </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >for offences with children until he went to live in Eccles in 1995 ...when two young boys made an indecent video at his shop using his own camcorder. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Roberts admitted the offence and was cautioned, technically for possession of an indecent photograph, although he was never taken to court. The Crown Prosecution Service said a court case was not necessary because of Roberts' previous good character.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >The decision was also taken to spare the two boys the ordeal of having to give evidence.</New>
