<New PAsource="" >A VILLAGE </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >shopkeeper </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was jailed for life yesterday for murdering 12-year-old </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas Marshall.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Kevan Roberts, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >52, was unanimously convicted of strangling </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, whose parents immediately denounced his killer for tainting the boy's reputation during the trial at </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Norwich Crown Court.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >John </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Carol Marshall, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Happisburgh, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Norfolk, said that the depiction of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >as a boy who smoked, took drugs and taunted Roberts for his homosexuality, was unrecognisable. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Justice Smedley </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >said that the boy may not have been an angel, but very few of that age were and he did not deserve to die.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Thomas disappeared on August 21, 1997, after telling his parents that he intended to ride his mountain bike to a friend's house. In fact he went to Roberts's corner shop in Eccles-on-Sea, Norfolk, where he was strangled with his own necklace. His body was found 50 miles away the next day.</New>


<New PAsource="" >The police launched a £2 million murder hunt, interviewing 3,000 people, returning to the shop more than a year later to search again for evidence that would convict Roberts. It was then that they found the vital bead from Thomas's necklace stuck in the U-bend of the sink in the kitchen at the back.</New>
