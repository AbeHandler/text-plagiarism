<Verbatim PAsource="" >A SHOPKEEPER was </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >jailed for life </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >for strangling a </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >12-year-old </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >boy he feared would expose his homosexual interest in children. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Kevan Roberts, 52, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Eccles, Norfolk, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was convicted of murdering </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas Marshall, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >probably at his bungalow behind his store, more than two years ago.</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >The </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >unmarried homosexual </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had earlier been cautioned by police for "helping" two teenagers make an indecent video in the bathroom of his home, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Norwich Crown Court </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was told.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >While Roberts </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in jail </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >awaiting trial, </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >he told two inmates that he considered </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas a "rent boy" </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and he hated him. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Thomas's family yesterday strongly denied allegations that the child was involved with sex and drugs. </New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The judge, Mr Justice Smedley, told Roberts: "You have been found guilty by the jury of strangling to death a young boy</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" > of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >12. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >You described him to a witness as 'not an angel'. I have no doubt he was not - very few 12-year-olds are - but he didn't deserve to die in the appalling way you treated him."</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >disappeared </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >after cycling from his home in Happisburgh, Norfolk, on the evening of 21 August 1997. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >His </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >body was found next day, 50 miles away near Thetford, in a picnic area used by </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >gay </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >men.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >He had been strangled </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >with </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >his shoelace necklace and round-necked T-shirt. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Marks </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >on his body suggested </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >may </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >have been sexually abused.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >The jury was told that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >two years before </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the murder, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >police had cautioned Roberts over </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the obscene </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >video he had helped two teenagers make. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The boys </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had also </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >watched some of Roberts's collection of pornographic videos, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >which </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >included titles such as Teen Sex and Action Boys. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was born in northwest London, and moved to Eccles in the mid-Nineties so he could be near his sister.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas had become a regular visitor </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >to Roberts' Granville's Stores on the Bush estate </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in the summer of 1997. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >But it took a year to link Roberts with his murder. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Charles Wide QC, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for the prosecution, </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >said a breakthrough had stemmed from Thomas's broken shoelace necklace, found lying on his shoulder with </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >two tiny beads missing.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >A matching bead was found in the U-bend under a sink in Roberts's bungalow. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >In a £2m investigation, officers travelled </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to Hong Kong </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >to trace the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >beads. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >They also monitored Roberts's movements and discovered he was </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >having </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >an </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >affair </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >with his </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >cousin, Peter Roberts, manager of a dairy </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thetford, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >near where the murdered boy's body was left.</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >A former </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >neighbour </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >told the court she saw the shopkeeper in his garden </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >standing </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >over </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >an upturned mountain bike </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >around the time </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >vanished. </New>


<New PAsource="" >The boy's parents, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >John </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Carol Marshall, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >yesterday said that </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had misrepresented their child in court. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Mr </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Marshall</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, who is in his early fifties, said: </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"He had a stable and loving family. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >We did not permit him to smoke, and do not believe his references to drugs were any more than adolescent bravado. He was generally considerate and polite, although at times cheeky, like any 12-year-old boy."</Verbatim>
