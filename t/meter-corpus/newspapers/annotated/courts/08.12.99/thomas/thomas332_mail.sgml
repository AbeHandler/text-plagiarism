<New PAsource="" >THEY should have been celebrating Thomas's 15th birthday this week. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Instead </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >John and Carol Marshall </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >are fighting for the reputation of their only child after his name was repeatedly blackened by the man who abused and killed him.</New>


<New PAsource="" >As they watched the 13-day trial of former sailor </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Kevan Roberts </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >the couple's grief was compounded as they heard sickening claims about their son's 'secret life', Including the paedophile's description of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >as a </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'rent boy'. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Following yesterday's guilty verdict, archivist Mr </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Marshall, 52, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and his 48-year-old librarian wife Issued a moving statement. </New>
<New PAsource="" >It said: 'We would like to correct the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >biased </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >view of our son portrayed in court by the defendant and his counsel for their own ends. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Until the end of the trial the law has denied us any reply. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >No one who knew him would recognise the boy they described as our Thomas. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >He had a stable and loving family We did not permit him to smoke and do not believe his references to drugs were any more than bravado. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Affectionate and loving at home, he was generally considerate and polite, although at times cheeky like any 12-year-old boy. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas was Intelligent and strong-willed and very anxious to appear grown-up. Inquisitive by nature, he lacked the experience to deal with a situation into which his curiosity had led him. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Many children find themselves in such a position most are fortunate to meet people who guide them safely beyond this stage.'</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >For </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >it was not to be. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Though described as streetwise, he was stifi a child who was lured into a world of drugs, shoplifting and homosexual activity by Roberts. The former Royal Navy medic was an outsider brought up in Willesden, North West London. </New>
<New PAsource="" >After the death of his mother Gladys, he moved to Eccles-on-Sea, Norfolk, to live near his sister in one of the ramshackle bungalows built as holiday homes. On the isolated Bush Estate, he bought the tiny Granville's Store with a two-bedroom bungalow attached for £37,000 in 1995. Soon boys were hanging around the shop, cadging and stealing cigarettes and spending their days with the diminutive owner. Roberts was cautioned In 1995 for having a video of one of those boys emerging from the shower. </New>
<New PAsource="" >His homosexuality got him drummed out of the Navy in 1972 when a man he had 'married' in a gay ceremony sent compromising photographs to his commander. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Before moving to Norfolk, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >lived In Neasden, North West London, where he worked at an IKEA furniture store after being made redundant by the Post Office.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Residents there recall how he would watch local boys playing football and lure them into his house with sweets and videos. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Roberts used the same bait to attract boys in Norfolk. His general store was described by one detective as a 'child magnet'. Thomas, who lived three miles away in Happisburgh, once boasted to his friend Adrian Smith that he had used cannabis and amphetamines at the shop. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Another 14-year-old friend, who cannot be named, said </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >would delight in 'annoying' </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >'It was about being gay or something like that,' said the boy. 

On the night of August 21, 1997, Roberts had arranged to meet Thomas at the shop. </New>
<New PAsource="" >`Fearing the child was about to tell police about their liaison, he killed him by pulling his tee-shirt collar and bootlace necklace tight against the arteries of his neck. Other bruises also suggested a sexual assault. Once he had dumped Thomas's bicycle Roberts tried to throw police oft the scent by leaving the body at a homosexual meeting point - a lay-by at Roudham Heath off the A11 near Thetford, 50 miles away. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Detectives believe Roberts whose naval duties included assisting at post-mortems. wrapped the body in bin-liners to ensure there was no incriminating transfer of fibres. Roberts was swiftly targeted as a suspect once the body was found. But, despite his record and association with the boy, it was not until 13 months later and a record £2million inquiry that the Norfolk Constabulary got their man. Within days of the murder, detectives took away his car for examination, but they did not search his house until the next year, when a crucial bead from Thomas's necklace was found in the sink trap. </New>
<New PAsource="" >The clue led police to </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hong Kong, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >where the necklace was made.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Detective Chief Inspector Bill Goreham, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >who led the inquiry said: </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'There were thousands and thousands of these necklaces. What we can say now with certainty is that the bead is from the same batch as the necklace Thomas was wearing.' </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >An examination of Roberts's phone bills would have revealed the crucial link with Thetford. His married cousin, Peter Roberts, lived there and the pair had been in a homosexual relationship since their teens.</New>


<New PAsource="" >On the night of the murder, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Kevan Roberts </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >cancelled a meeting with the cousin who had been due to visit him. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Thomas's dismantled mountain bike was found at Brumstead Common, five miles from Eccles but it was only a week into the trial - more than two years after the murder - that a witness came forward linking it to Roberts. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Emma Coleman, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >19, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >read a report of the trial </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >remembered </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >seeing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts standing in front of an upturned reddish-pink mountain bike with something in his hand at </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >about </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the time Thomas vanished. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >She told the jury: 'When I read about the bike being dismantled I thought "Oh God". I felt sick. The significance never occurred to me before.' </Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >On remand, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >told another prisoner he was haunted by the death and how the eyes in a police poster of Thomas, pinned up at his shop, 'would follow him wherever he went'.</New>


<New PAsource="" >He is not the only one. Howard Adams, of Happisburgh parish council, said of the depravity unearthed during the trial: 'It has been disgusting, shocking and very upsetting.'</New>


<New PAsource="" >The remote villages on Norfolk's coast would seem to many to be the ideal spot to bring up a child. </New>
<New PAsource="" >A low crime rate, little traffic, a strong sense of community and mile upon mile of beaches offer a combination which most inner-city parent would envy. </New>
<New PAsource="" >But, if the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >murder </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas Marshall </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >has any lessons, it is that there seems no longer to be any such thing as a safe place for children to grow up.</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The judge, Mr Justice Smedley, </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >let's make no bones about it - It was abuse of Thomas by Roberts.' </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >He described the killer as 'a very intelligent man, cold and calculating'. </New>
<New PAsource="" >He added: </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'Roberts, like many </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >paedophlles, </New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >50 miles </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >away at an infamous gay haunt.</New>
  

<New PAsource="" >He was charged more than a year later after a £2million inquiry when a chrome bead from the necklace was found in a pipe from his kitchen sink. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Yesterday Thomas's parents, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >John and Carol, </Verbatim>
