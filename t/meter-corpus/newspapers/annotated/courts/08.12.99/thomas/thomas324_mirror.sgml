<New PAsource="" >EVIL </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >shopkeeper Kevan Roberts was jailed for life </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >for the murder of 12-year-old Thomas Marshall.</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >He used the schoolboy's own necklace to strangle him, fearing his sex secrets were about to be exposed.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Fair-haired </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was killed in the village shop, which was described by one policeman as a "child magnet". </New>
<New PAsource="" >Youngsters gathered there, lured by sweets and cigarettes. </New>
<New PAsource="" >But parents in the quiet seaside hamlet of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Eccles, Norfolk, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >did not know about 52-year-old Roberts' perverted private life.</New>


<New PAsource="" >After killing </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >he dumped his body in a lay-by </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >50 miles </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >away at a homosexuals' pick-up haunt. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >enticed the boy into a sexual relationship. </New>
<New PAsource="" >But he became terrified that </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was about to lift the lid on his sordid life. </New>


<New PAsource="" >During the trial, it emerged </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had been quizzed by police 18 months before the killing over his lust for boys. </New>
<New PAsource="" >He was released after being cautioned for allowing two teenagers to make indecent films in his bathroom using his camcorder. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Yesterday the jury at </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Norwich Crown Court </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >reached </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a unanimous murder verdict.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The judge </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >told </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts: "You have been found guilty of strangling to death a young boy of 12. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >You described him to </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >witnesses </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >as 'not an angel' </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and he </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >no doubt wasn't - very few 12-year-old boys are. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >But he didn't deserve to die in the appalling way you treated him".</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >showed no emotion as Mr </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Justice Smedley </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >gave him a life sentence and indicated he would have to serve at least 10 years before parole would be considered. </New>
<New PAsource="" >He was sentenced the day after what would have been Thomas's 15th birthday. </New>
<New PAsource="" >The boy's parents, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >John, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >52, and </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Carol, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >48, both librarians, stayed away from court for the verdict.</New>


<New PAsource="" >The £2million police inquiry into Thomas's death was not solved until detectives found </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a bead </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >from </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas's necklace </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >trapped in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the U-bend </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts' </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >kitchen </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >sink. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >He had been strangled from behind by a combination of his shoelace-style necklace and tee-shirt. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Marks </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >on his body </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >indicated sexual </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >interference.</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >went missing in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >August, 1997. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >after telling his </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >parents he </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was cycling </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to see a </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >pal </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in Eccles. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >His </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >body was found next day </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >by a motorist </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >50 miles from his Happisburgh home. </Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Roberts was a suspect early on in the police probe after detectives found out Thomas's liking for the local shop. </New>
<New PAsource="" >But It was not until the bead was found in the kitchen pipe a year later that charges could be brought. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Roberts had bought the shop, called Granville's after the character in Open All Hours, after moving from London when he was made redundant from the Post Office.</New>


<New PAsource="" >An earlier career bid In the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Royal Navy </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had ended in dismissal when his spurned gay lover had sent compromising pictures of him to the commanding officer. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Villagers in </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Eccles </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >thought </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was a quiet, hardworking man. </New>
<New PAsource="" >But among his secrets was the gay affair his was having with his married cousin.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Howard Adams, parish council chairman, said: "Roberts enticed Thomas, whether it be with cigarettes or anything else. If he did that once he could have enticed another child."</New>


<New PAsource="" >And a local businessman said: "Thomas's parents do not recognise the boy who has been described in court. </New>
<New PAsource="" >"Whatever he may have done, he did not deserve to be killed by a sick monster."</New>
