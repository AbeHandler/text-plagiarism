<New PAsource="" >presented a "do anything for anybody" image to his customers - but he secretly inhabited a sleazy world of pornography, sex and child exploitation. </New>
<New PAsource="" >It was a shabby existence into which he drew schoolboy </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas Marshall </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >before killing him because he feared he was about to be unmasked. 
</New>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Depraved </Rewrite>

<New PAsource="" >As the homosexual loner was led away, the parents of hapless </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >attempted to correct </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >the image of their son who was dubbed in court a tear-away and a </New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >John Marshall 52, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and wife </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Carol, </Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >The couple, who attended most of the 13 days of the trial but were not in court yesterday, said </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and his counsel had given a biased view of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas </Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >He was </Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >at times cheeky, like any 12-year-old boy. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Inquisitive by nature, he lacked the experience to deal with a situation into which his curiosity had led him. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >strangled </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >at his shop in </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Eccles, Norfolk, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >then drove 50 miles to a Thetford lay-by to dump the body in undergrowth. </New>
<New PAsource="" >The reclusive loner, who showed no emotion at the jury's guilty verdict, was told by </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Justice Smedley: "You described </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >the young boy </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >as 'not an angel' </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >no doubt he wasn't. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Few 12-year-old boys are. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >But he didn't deserve to die in </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >such in </New>

<New PAsource="" >The judge indicated </New>

<New PAsource="" >he would recommend that </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >served at least 10 years before being able to apply for parole. </New>
<New PAsource="" >The prosecution said </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >murdered </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >because he feared the boy was about to tell police of their secret sexual relationship.

<New PAsource="" >The police officer who led the murder hunt, Det </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Chief </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Insp </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Bill Goreham, said: </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >"Thomas's parents were largely unaware of some of the things he was doing."
</New>

<New PAsource="" >He said the key to the inquiry was the discovery of a bead from Thomas's necklace in the U-bend of Roberts' sink more than a year after the schoolboy's violent death.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had been strangled with the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >necklace, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >which snapped. </New>
<New PAsource="" >As a result, two beads were missing. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Chief </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Insp </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Goreham </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >said that when a tiny metallic bead was found there was a buzz of excitement among the 50-strong team of officers investigating the case. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Detectives travelled to </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hong Kong </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >where Thomas's necklace was made and forensic tests were carried out on the bead found in the U-bend. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Chief </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Insp </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Goreham said: "We can say now with certainty the bead </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >from the same batch </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >as those in Thomas's necklace</New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >." </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Unknown to residents of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Eccles,

Roberts </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had been living a sordid and disturbing private life for years.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >When he closed the doors of Granville's Stores on the Bush estate he retreated into his sad world of seedy sexual liaisons. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >who lived in Neasden, north-west London, until the mid-90s, realised he was homosexual in his teens when he indulged in playground sex acts with his cousin. </New>
<New PAsource="" >At 24 he joined the Royal Navy as a medical assistant but was discharged two years later when his CO learned that he had gone through a homosexual "marriage". </New>
