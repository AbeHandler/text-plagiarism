<New PAsource="" >A PAEDOPHILE shopkeeper was sentenced to life imprisonment yesterday for strangling a 12-year-old schoolboy he had been sexually abusing.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Kevan Roberts</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, 52, a homosexual described by police as "cold and calculating", was found guilty of murdering Thomas Marshall in a unanimous verdict by a jury at Norwich Crown Court.</New>


<New PAsource="" >The shopkeeper, of Eccles on Sea, Norfolk, killed </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, an only child who would have been 15 on Tuesday, because he feared he was about to expose him.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Speaking after the verdict, the boy's parents, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >John Marshall</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, 52, an archivist, and his wife </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Carol</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, 48, a part-time librarian, said: </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Although nothing can bring </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >him </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >back, the jailing of Roberts will ensure that he is not able to prey on other children."</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Mr and Mrs </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Marshall</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, of Happisburgh, Norfolk, said they wanted to correct the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"biased" </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >view of their son that his killer, who described him as a "rent boy", had portrayed in court.</New>


<New PAsource="" >They said: </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Affectionate and loving at home, he was generally considerate and polite, although at times cheeky like any 12-year-old. Inquisitive by nature, he lacked the experience to deal with a situation into which his curiosity had led him."</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Roberts nodded as </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Justice Smedley </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >passed a life sentence yesterday, following nearly 10 hours of deliberation by the jury. </New>
<New PAsource="" >He told Roberts: </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"You have been found guilty by the jury of strangling to death a young boy of 12. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >You described him to </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >witnesses </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >as 'not an angel'. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >I have no doubt he was not. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Very few 12-year-olds are. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >But he did not deserve to die in the appalling way </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >in which </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >you treated him."</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Det Chief Insp Bill Goreham, who led the £2 million inquiry by Norfolk police, later condemned Roberts for trying to blacken Thomas's name by saying they were involved in a sexual relationship.</New>


<New PAsource="" >He said: </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Let's make no bones about it. It was not a relationship, it was abuse of Thomas by Roberts. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Kevan Roberts, like so many people like him, lived a lie, covering his tracks. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >People don't always realise </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >quite what </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >they have on their doorstep </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >until something awful happens</New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >."</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >During the two-week trial, the jury heard how Thomas became a frequent visitor to Roberts's shop in the summer of 1997, after meeting him through a friend who lived near the shop, described as a "child magnet" by one officer.</New>


<New PAsource="" >At some point during that summer "something sexual" developed between Roberts and the schoolboy. </New>
<New PAsource="" >The night he killed Thomas, Roberts had been expecting the schoolboy at his shop and told his cousin, Peter Roberts, with whom he was having a homosexual affair, that it would not be convenient to see him. </New>
<New PAsource="" >He strangled the boy, possibly while he was fetching a drink of water from the sink, by grabbing his T-shirt collar and necklace and pulling them tight around his neck.</New>

<New PAsource="" >Roberts then dismantled the boy's bike before throwing it into a local fly-tipping area at Brumstead Common. He then drove 50 miles and dumped Thomas's body near a lay-by off the A11, near Thetford.</New>


<New PAsource="" >The shopkeeper denied murder and said he had spent the night of the killing alone at his shop. </New>
<New PAsource="" >But during the trial, the jury heard from Roy Reynolds, a convicted paedophile who met Roberts while he was on remand awaiting trial.</New>


<New PAsource="" >He said Roberts had told him he came "very close to admitting the murder" and that Thomas had taken less than a minute and a half to die.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Reynolds also claimed Roberts confessed to hating Thomas, that he felt he was taking over his life and that he felt the boy </New>
