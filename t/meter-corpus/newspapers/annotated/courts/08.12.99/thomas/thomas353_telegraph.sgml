<New PAsource="" >FOR more than a year Kevan Roberts believed he had got away with the murder. Detectives questioned him soon after the killing, but did not charge him. The shopkeeper, however, made crucial errors.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >He thought that he could hide his link to Roudham Heath picnic area, near Thetford, a known venue for homosexuals, where he had dumped Thomas's body, simply by denying it.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >He failed to realise that a small but significant piece of evidence which was to convict him was lodged in the waste pipe from his sink.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Police initially were hampered by a lack of solid forensic evidence.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >They were trying to find someone with links to both the Happisburgh area and Thetford.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Roberts, who had run a store in Eccles since the mid-Nineties, denied any links with Thetford. But detectives discovered that he was in touch with someone there.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Further inquiries led them to Roberts's cousin, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Peter Roberts</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, the manager of a Thetford dairy, and it emerged that the two men had been having a homosexual affair for five years.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Police then discovered that Peter Roberts had called Roberts at 7.59pm on Aug 21, the evening that Thomas vanished and that his cousin had answered the telephone.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Detectives already knew that Roberts had bought cannabis from a neighbour, saying he was expecting a visitor that evening.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >They also knew that Thomas had been excited and in a hurry to go somewhere on the night he vanished.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >At this point detectives focused their interest on Thomas's necklace. It had been caught up in the collar of the boy's shirt, which told police that he was strangled from behind. But two tiny silver-coloured beads were missing from the front of the necklace.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Det Chief Insp </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Bill Goreham</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, who led the murder inquiry, said: </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"The search for those two beads became a major line of inquiry."
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >Roberts's flat was searched and the vital bead was found in the U-bend beneath the sink in his kitchen.</New>
