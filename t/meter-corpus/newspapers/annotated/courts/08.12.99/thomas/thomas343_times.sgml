<New PAsource="" >A PAEDOPHILE who lured a 12-year-old boy into his village shop and sexually abused him was sentenced to life imprisonment yesterday for his murder.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >After </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Kevan Roberts </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was unanimously convicted of strangling </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas Marshall </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >with his own necklace, the boy's parents spoke out to defend their son against the "biased view" of him portrayed in court by his killer.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >John Marshall</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, an archivist, and his wife, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Carol</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, a librarian, said: "No one who knew him would recognise the boy described as our Thomas. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Inquisitive by nature, he lacked the experience to deal with a situation into which his curiosity had led him. Many children find themselves in such a position, most are fortunate to meet people who guide them safely beyond this stage."
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, 52, claimed in court that </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, who vanished after leaving his home in </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Happisburgh, Norfolk, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >to ride his mountain bike to a friend's house nearby, was a "nuisance" who taunted him about his homosexuality, smoked and took drugs.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >However, he denied any sexual relationship. </New>
<New PAsource="" >The jury at </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Norwich Crown Court </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >found him guilty of murder after deliberations lasting nearly ten hours. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, who ran Granville's corner shop at Eccles-on-Sea, nodded at the judge when told that he would go to prison for life.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Mr Justice Smedley </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said he would recommend that Roberts </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >served a period of years </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"well into double figures", </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >adding: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"You have been found guilty of strangling to death a young boy of 12. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >You described him to </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >witnesses </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >as 'not an angel'. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >I have no doubt </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he was not. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Very few 12-year-old </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >boys </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >are. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >But he did not deserve to die in the appalling way in which you treated him."
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >The court had been told that Thomas, an only child who would have been 15 on Tuesday, was strangled because Roberts feared that he would expose their relationship. </New>
<New PAsource="" >His body was dumped at </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roudham Heath, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >near Thetford on August 22, 1997, the day after he vanished.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Police arrested the shopkeeper more than a year later when they discovered one of two beads from the bootlace necklace that Roberts used to strangle the boy caught in the U-bend sink trap in his kitchen.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >The court was told that Roberts admitted to police that he found adolescent boys attractive, but denied ever having a sexual relationship with one. </New>
<New PAsource="" >However, while on remand at Norwich Prison, he told the convicted paedophile </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roy Reynolds </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >of his involvement with Thomas.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Mr and Mrs </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Marshall, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >who had attended the 12-day trial until the jury retired to consider its verdict, said in a statement: </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Thomas </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >had a stable and loving family. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >We did not permit him to smoke and do not believe his references to drugs were any more than adolescent bravado. Affectionate and loving at home, he was generally considerate and polite, although at times cheeky like any 12-year-old boy. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas was intelligent and strong willed and very anxious to appear grown-Up.' </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >The statement, read by Thomas's aunt, Marie Breame, added: </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >We are relieved that justice has been done. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Although nothing can bring Thomas back, the jailing of Roberts will ensure that he is not able to prey on other children."
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >The police investigation, which cost £2 million and involved inter views with 3,000 people, was led by </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Detective Chief Inspector Bill Goreham, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >who said yesterday: </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >I think it's evident there had been a relationship between Roberts and Thomas. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Let's make no bones about it, it was </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >no </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >relationship, it was abuse of Thomas. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Kevan Roberts is a very intelligent man, very cold </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >calculating. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >He obviously thought about what he had done and to a large extent covered his tracks </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >before we even realised we had a murder inquiry. </New>
<New PAsource="" >There has been some satisfaction in the verdict, but it is not a day for celebrating. This is a tragic set of circumstances. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Kevan Roberts, like so many people like him, lived a lie covering his tracks. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >People don't always realise </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >quite what </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >they have on their doorsteps </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >until something awful happens</New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >".
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >Mr Goreham said that he felt humbled by the faith that Thomas's parents had shown in the police during the protracted murder inquiry.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >He also paid tribute to the courage of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roy Reynolds</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, who is serving life for serious offences against boys. </New>
<New PAsource="" >He could face "dire consequences" in prison for giving evidence against Roberts.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >As Roberts was taken down to the police cells at the court he showed no emotion. 
</New>

<New PAsource="" >He will be separated from other prisoners for his own safety and serve his sentence in the company of other sex offenders. When he eventually leaves prison he will be placed on the sex offenders' register.
