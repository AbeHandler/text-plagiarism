<Verbatim PAsource="" >KEVAN ROBERTS </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was a convincing liar who arrogantly believed that he had got away with strangling 12-year-old </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas Marshall.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Detectives questioned the diminutive, bespectacled shopkeeper soon after the boy's body had been found dumped at a picnic site in August 1997, but Roberts was convinced that he had covered his tracks. </New>
<New PAsource="" >However, so certain were Norfolk police about Roberts's guilt that the force would spend more than £2 million in its most expensive investigation to find the evidence that would convict him.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Most villagers in Eccles-on Sea had long since guessed that </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, 52, was a homosexual, although none knew the details of his sordid past. </New>
<New PAsource="" >He had been cautioned by police in November 1995 after he lured two teenage boys into videoing themselves naked in his bathroom. Detectives decided not to prosecute him to spare the youngsters from giving evidence in court.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Before that, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had been dishonourably discharged from the Royal Navy in 1974 after it was discovered that he had gone through a homosexual marriage to a man called Lewis Hamilton, a civilian. He changed his name by deed poll to Hamilton, but his partner insisted that Roberts leave the Navy and, when he refused, sent compromising photographs to his commanding officers at Plymouth. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Denied the career that he had coveted since schooldays, Roberts, now reverting to his original name, drifted into a job with the Post Office at St Albans.</New>


<New PAsource="" >When he took redundancy, he sold his terraced home in West London to buy the general store 140 miles away for £37,000. The business proved a financial disaster, but there were compensations. </New>
<New PAsource="" >He cultivated the company of schoolchildren, using the cover of the corner shop beside the bus stop where they would arrive home from school. He would give them cigarettes and entertain them in the scruffy two-bedroom bungalow behind the shop. </New>
<New PAsource="" >In April 1997 Thomas, a flaxen-haired, cheeky 12-year-old, was introduced to the shopkeeper. He visited Granville's regularly on his pink mountain bike or on the Yamaha scrambler motorbike that his father had given him. </New>
<New PAsource="" >A secret sexual relationship was alleged to have developed between </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and the boy during the summer. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >became fearful that Thomas was about to tell the police about their liaison. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Still nobody except </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >knows exactly what happened between them in the minutes leading up to the murder. </New>
<New PAsource="" >As he began his life sentence last night, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >refused relatives' pleas to confess his guilt and tell them what happened. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Detectives believe that Roberts attacked the boy from behind, strangling him with the bootlace-style necklace that he had bought that summer. The cheap, beaded necklace cost the boy £1.99, but it was the precious piece of evidence that would ultimately damn Roberts to a life behind bars. </New>
<New PAsource="" >A year after the murder, Detective Chief Inspector Bill Goreham asked his officers to go back and search Roberts's home again. Inside the bungalow police found two metal beads from the necklace trapped in the U-bend of his kitchen sink. Officers travelled to Hong Kong to find the manufacturer to link these two beads to Thomas's necklace. </New>
<New PAsource="" >The rest of the broken necklace was still around the boy's neck when </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >his body was </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >discovered </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >50 miles </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >from where he was murdered at </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roudham Heath </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >- a lay-by on the A11 near Thetford that was </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >used as a </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >pick-up point by homosexuals.</Rewrite>


<New PAsource="" >Police charged him with murder, although </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Roberts </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >boasted that there was still not enough evidence to convict him. </New>
<New PAsource="" >No one had seen Thomas Marshall or his distinctive bicycle on the evening of August 21 and no one had seen Roberts leave his home or ever witnessed the couple together. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Then, a week into the trial - and two years after the murder - a new witness came forward. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Emma Coleman, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >19, a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >neighbour </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >him </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >dismantling </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >an upturned pink mountain bike </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in his yard.</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Goreham said: "That was a key piece of evidence, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >that and the difficult task of matching those beads. It was amazing how many inquiries could spring from something as simple as a bead.</New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >The Marshall family had links to the village going back more than 200 years. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Thomas</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, the only child of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >John Marshall</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, 52, a Norfolk County Council archivist, and </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Carol</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, 48, a librarian, grew up at the Forge, in Happisburgh, where generations of the family have lived since 1770.</New>


<New PAsource="" >He had just completed his studies at Stalham Middle School, about five miles away, with an impressive collection of A grades and was described by his head teacher, Jim Scott, as "an intelligent boy".</New>


<New PAsource="" >The villagers have already devised their way to remember Thomas's murder. A "Stairway to Heaven" is to be built to the top of the 11Oft flint tower at the 15th-century parish church of St Mary the Virgin in Happisburgh in his memory. The 900 villagers have so far raised £17,000 towards it. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Thomas is buried in the churchyard in a </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >grave decorated by </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a toy motorcycle.</Verbatim>
