<Verbatim PAsource="" >NEIL HAMILTON made </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >dramatic climbdown </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >High Court </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >when he </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >abandoned his claim that he should have </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >reached </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Shadow Cabinet were it not for Mohamed Al Fayed's "pack of lies" over the "cash for questions" affair.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Tory former </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >minister </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >dropped the assertion made on Tuesday minutes into his cross-examination by </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >George Carman, QC, for the Harrods' </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >owner, </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >who had read out the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >critical findings of a 1997 Select Committee on Standards and Privileges </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >into Mr Hamilton's conduct as an MP.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The committee had found that the list of interests Mr Hamilton had not registered "adds up to a casualness bordering on indifference or contempt towards the rules of the House on disclosure of interests". </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >The list included two Harrods hampers, payments totalling £16,000 from Ian Greer, the political lobbyist, and a three-night stay in an hotel in New York paid for by US Tobacco. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The committee concluded that, had Mr Hamilton, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who lost his seat at the last general election, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >still been </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >an MP, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >it would have recommended a "substantial period of suspension".</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Carman </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >asked: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Are you seriously saying that, in the light of those grave findings against you by a select committee of the House of Commons in 1997, that if you had the great fortune ever to be returned to Tatton or any other constituency you would have a realistic prospect of serving in the Shadow Cabinet on the front bench now?"</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Watched by his wife, Christine, and Mr Al Fayed, Mr Hamilton replied: "Well, MrMandelson is back in the Cabinet."</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Carman went on: "And since when did a select committee make findings that he would be suspended?" Mr Hamilton said: "Well, he was subject to a very great deal of criticism." </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >He went on to tell Mr Carman that "with respect" they were not in court to consider the findings of the select committee but to debate the "extremely grave" allegations made </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >by </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Al Fayed.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton is suing Mr Al Fayed over allegations that he had corruptly demanded and accepted cash payments, gift vouchers and a free holiday at the Paris Ritz in return for asking parliamentary questions on behalf of Harrods.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Mr Carman repeated his question as to whether Mr Hamilton was </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >seriously asking </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >the jury to award him </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >damages </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for the loss of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >career </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >prospects, </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >which included the possibility that he would be serving as a front-bench spokesman. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton said: "I'm very happy to exclude from the damages any possibility of being a front-bench spokesman. I'm quite happy to abandon that specific point."</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Earlier, Mr Hamilton told the court that </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he resigned </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >as a minister </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >on October 25, 1994, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >the day </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >after attending a "hanging committee" </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >of the Tory high command shortly after The Guardian "cash for questions" story broke. </New>
<New PAsource="" >He had been called to a </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >meeting </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >with </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Richard Ryder, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Chief Whip, Sir Robin Butler, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Cabinet Secretary, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Michael Heseltine, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >President of the Board of Trade. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"The decision had obviously been taken, even before I arrived at the meeting, that my position was untenable," </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >he </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >It </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was "not because they believed the allegations against me" but the "accumulating pressure" made it too much of a distraction for "</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >me </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >as a minister and the Government as a whole". </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Desmond Browne, QC, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >asked him about </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the allegation that he had "corruptly" taken a £10,000 payment from Mobil </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Oil. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton said that in April 1989 he was approached on </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mobil's </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >behalf by </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >leading tax QC, Peter Whiteman, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who left him in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >no doubt </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >after a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >meeting </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I should be retained in a consultancy capacity".</Verbatim> 


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The hearing </Verbatim>
