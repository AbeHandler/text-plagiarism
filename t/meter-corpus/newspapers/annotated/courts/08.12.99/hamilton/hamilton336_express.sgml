<New PAsource="" >FORMER Tory MP </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Neil Hamilton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >last night made a dramatic climbdown in his libel battle with Harrods boss </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mohamed Al Fayed.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >He had stated he would now be holding a leading position in the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Shadow Cabinet </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >if he had not been forced to resign amid allegations that he took bribes.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Part of his claim for damages was based on the loss of earnings he claims he has suffered. But after cross-examination by Mr Fayed's QC, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >George Carman</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, Mr </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hamilton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >abandoned that part of his claim.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Carman </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >detailed the damning findings of the Select Committee on Privileges and Standards in 1997 which said that had </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >still been an MP they would have called for him to be suspended for a substantial period.</New>


<New PAsource="" >They accused him of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a "casualness bordering on indifference or contempt </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the rules of the House" </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >in failing to disclose benefits and cash payments totalling some £16,000.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Carman </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >asked him: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Are you seriously saying that in the light of those </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >very </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >grave findings...you would have a realistic prospect of serving in the Shadow Cabinet?" </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton replied: "Mr Mandelson is back in the Cabinet."</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >But </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Carman </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >retorted: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"And </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >since when did Mr Mandelson get criticised by a select committee or threatened with suspension?</New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton subsequently conceded: </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >am </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >very happy to exclude from </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >any </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >damages </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >possibility </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >that I would have been </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a front bench spokesman." </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >claims </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Fayed made </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >false </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >allegations </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >on </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a Channel 4 Dispatches programme </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >that he pocketed up to £110,000 in cash and vouchers from the tycoon for lobbying on his behalf in Parliament.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Questioned by his own QC Desmond Browne, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, 50, told how he deliberately dodged tax on a "windfall" consultancy payment. </New>
<New PAsource="" >He admitted he did not want to hand to the Inland Revenue more than half of the £4,000 he was paid by parliamentary lobbyist </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Ian Greer </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >in return for finding him an industrial client.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Instead he struck a deal under which he bought items for himself and his wife Christine and sent the bills to Mr Greer. They included a £700 painting, £1,594 in air fares to the US and shopping totalling £959 from John Lewis. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >said </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Greer </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >paid him £10,000 for two commissions for finding clients in the late Eighties, which the select committee later found were not properly registered.</New>


<New PAsource="" >He also told the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >High Court </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >he had not felt it necessary to </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >register </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >a six-night stay at the Paris Ritz, which he enjoyed at Mr Fayed's expense.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >also detailed other gifts he received from Mr Fayed, including teddy bears, ties and bottles of whisky. </New>
<New PAsource="" >He stayed at the Paris flat of his late son Dodi, and at his Scottish castle at Balnagown.</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >In return, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he said he gave Mr Fayed House of Commons whisky </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >brandy </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >as well as a pair of 9ct gold </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >cufflinks </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >bearing the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Commons portcullis </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >crest.</Rewrite> 


<Rewrite PAsource="" >The case continues.</Rewrite>
