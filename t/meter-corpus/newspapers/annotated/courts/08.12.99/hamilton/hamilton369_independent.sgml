<Verbatim PAsource="" >NEIL HAMILTON </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >dropped one of his main claims for damages against </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mohamed Al Fayed </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday after </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >just </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >22 </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >minutes </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >cross-examination by George Carman QC.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >The </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >High Court </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had long been awaiting the questioning of the former MP for </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Tatton, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Cheshire, by the counsel for the owner of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Harrods, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >the formidable </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Carman. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >It came late in the day, but those present were taken aback by the speed with which the barrister closed in. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Even evoking the name of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Peter Mandelson </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >did not help </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >The former Tory minister had told the jury that he was a "very popular" member of John Major's government, his political career was destined for the top and </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >would probably </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >have been </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a member of William Hague's </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >shadow cabinet, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >if </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >not for Mr Fayed's "lies" </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >about </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >cash for questions.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Beginning his cross-examination, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Carman </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >described the strong criticism of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >by a House of Commons select committee, which found that he had "fallen seriously and constantly below the standard expected of an MP".</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Carman </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >then asked Mr Hamilton </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Are you seriously saying </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >to the jury, 'Award me damages for the loss of my career prospects, which include the possibility that I'd be serving in the shadow cabinet or as a front-bench spokesman now' in the light of the fact that the select committee found in 1991 that if you were a serving member you'd have deserved a substantial period of suspension?</New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >responded </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Well, Mr Mandelson is back in the Cabinet..."</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Carman </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >interjected - </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >"When was </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Mandelson </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >criticised by </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a select committee, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >or threatened with suspension from the House?"</New>


<New PAsource="" >After a slight hesitation, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton said: "I </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >am </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >happy to exclude from </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >any </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >damages </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that I would be </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a front-bench spokesman."</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Carmen </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >pounced: "Are you withdrawing that?"</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >replied: </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Yes, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >I </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >am </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >quite happy to abandon that specific point".</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >50, was giving evidence on the 15th day of his libel action against </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Fayed </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >over allegations that he accepted cash, gifts and free holidays, including one at the Paris Ritz hotel, for asking questions favourable to the Harrods owner in the Commons.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Fayed </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >turned up in the afternoon to hear his lawyer grill </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Both the public gallery and the court were full with MPs and lawyers from other cases crowding in. </New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Carman </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >clashed at the very start of the cross-examination. </New>
<New PAsource="" >The politician accused the barrister of telling the jury "half-truths" about him in his opening statements. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Mr Carmen recounted the findings of the Commons Standards and Privileges Committee after the Downey report on the cash-for-questions allegations - that Mr Hamilton's </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >conduct bordered on </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >indifference </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >contempt towards the rules of the House </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the disclosure of interests". </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Mr Carman promised Mr Hamilton that he would be examining all aspects of the former MP's behaviour including his "lack of candour" in dealing with the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Deputy Prime Minister </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >at the time, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Michael Heseltine, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Cabinet Secretary, Sir Robin Butler and </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >Tory </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Chief Whip, Richard Ryder.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Earlier Mr Hamilton described how he had resigned from his post of Minister for Corporate Affairs after being summoned to </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"a hanging committee" </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >attended by Mr </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Headtine, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mr </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Ryder and Sir Robin. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >They questioned him about the allegations of corruption levelled against him in newspaper articles. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >told the court: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"The decision had obviously been taken, even before I arrived at the meeting, that my position was untenable. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >This was not because they believed the allegations against </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >me </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >but because the accumulating pressure of the developing story made it too much of </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >a </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >distraction both for </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >myself </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >as a minister and the Government as a whole."</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was asked by his counsel, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Desmond Browne </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >QC, about commission payments </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >received </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >for </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >introducing commercial companies </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >political lobbyist Ian Greer. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >After one such </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >introduction, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the National Nuclear Corporation, Mr Hamilton received £4,000 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >commission from </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mr </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Greer. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >After another introduction, of the company </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >US Tobacco, Mr Hamilton </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >paid £6,000 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >commission </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >by the lobbyist. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >told the court that he regarded </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the commission </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >he took for introducing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >NNC </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >as a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >very welcome windfall" </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that he </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"didn't particularly desire to hand over half of" to the Inland Revenue.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >He asked Mr Greer </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >help him reduce the tax liability by "defraying the </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >bill, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >which I might run up over the course of the next few months" instead of giving him the whole amount </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >at once.</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton bought </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >a painting and </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >goods from a department store. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Those items </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >and air fares to the United States for </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >him </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >and his wife. Christine, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >cost </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >£1,594 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >were paid for by Mr Greer, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >leaving </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a balance of £746 from the £4,000 commission, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >which </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was eventually paid to him by cheque.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton said he did not enter his September 1987 stay at the Paris Ritz on the register of members' interests because it did not seem to him to be a registrable interest </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >according to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the rules as they stood: </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"No one else, to my knowledge, had registered hospitality of that kind, and there had been several invitees who </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had gone </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to Paris, and were flown out and didn't register. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Although members were not any less punctilious about their duties, they approached these questions in a less censorious and searching way."</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >The case continues.</New>
