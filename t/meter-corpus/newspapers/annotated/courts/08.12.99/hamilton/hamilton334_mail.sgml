<New PAsource="" >IT WAS the moment for which everyone in Court 13 had been waiting. </New>
<New PAsource="" >In the witness box, former Tory MP </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Neil Hamilton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >squared up for what are likely to be some of the most uncomfortable hours of his already uncomfortable life. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Below him, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >George Carman, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >QC, leaned on his lectern and fired his first questions on behalf of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mohammed Al Fayed. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >At stake was Mr Hamilton's claim that his career has been wrecked by the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Harrods </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >owner's allegedly false and libelous 'cash for questions' </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >allegations </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >on </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Channel 4's Dispatches.</Verbatim> 


<New PAsource="" >The former corporate affairs Minister, who lost his safe seat at </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Tatton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >in Cheshire in the 1997 General Election, says he would be on William Hague's front bench by now but for the furore. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Mr </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Carman </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >drew his attention to the findings of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Privileges and Standards. </New>
<New PAsource="" >It had investigated the claims against him about Harrods' hampers, nights at the Paris Ritz and the receipt of consultancy fees totalling more than £16,000. </New>
<New PAsource="" >'Your fellow Members of Parliament reached the conclusion that if you were a serving member of the House they would have imposed </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a substantial period of suspension </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >because you had fallen seriously and consistently below the standards of the House,' he said. </New>
<New PAsource="" >'That's a very grave criticism.' </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >agreed it was, but pointed out the committee was made up mostly of Labour MPs.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Carman </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >tried again. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'Are you seriously saying that, in the light of </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >these very serious allegations </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >against you, that if you had the good fortune ever to be returned to Tatton you would have a realistic prospect of serving on the front bench?'</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >'Mr Mandelson is back in the Cabinet,' </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >observed </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >'And since when,' </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >retorted </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Carman, 'did Mr Mandelson </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >get criticised by a </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >select committee </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >or get threatened by a suspension from the House?</New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >In the absence of a specific answer, Mr </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Carman </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >declared: 'I want to ask you again clearly this vital question. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Are you saying to the jury, "Award me damages </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >for the loss of my career prospects, which include the possibility </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >that I </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >would be serving as a front bench spokesman </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >now" in the light of the fact that a select committee found in 1997 that if you had been a serving member you would have deserved a substantial period of suspension?</New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >'I'm very happy,' said Mr Hamilton, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >who most obviously was not, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'to exclude from the damages </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >possibility of </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >ever </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >being a front bench spokesman.'</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Earlier, Mr Hamilton said Mr Al Fayed had often sent him unsolicited gifts, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >such as £100 Christmas hampers, ties and teddy bears. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >He said he did not regard them as bribes. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Asked if he gave gifts in return, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he said he </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >gave him </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >House of Commons whisky </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >brandy, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >adding: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'And I once gave him a pair of House of Commons portcullis cufflinks.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >'</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >He seemed very pleased to receive them at the time, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >but </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >he </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was later disparaging about them </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and said </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >they were </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >not </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >good enough for him.' </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hamilton </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >told how be stopped the taxman getting his hands on a </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >£4,000 </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >commission fee he was paid by Parliamentary lobbyist Ian Greer after winning a contract for him.</New>


<New PAsource="" >He used some of it to buy pictures, and air fares. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'I regarded this as a very welcome windfall and did </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >not </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >particularly desire to hand over half of it to the Inland Revenue.' </Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >He claimed he resigned as a minister not because he had done any thing wrong, but because of the sheer weight of allegations he faced. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >He said a 'hanging committee' </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Michael Heseltine, Tory chief whip Richard Ryder and Cabinet Secretary Sir Robin Butler </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >decided his </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >position was 'untenable'.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >The case continues.</New>
