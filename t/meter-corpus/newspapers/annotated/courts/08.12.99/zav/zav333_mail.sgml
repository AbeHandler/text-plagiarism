<Verbatim PAsource="" >LENA ZAVARONI </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >threatened to </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >kill herself unless </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >surgeons agreed to carry out a brain operation </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to treat her </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >depression, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >an inquest heard </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday.
</Rewrite>

<New PAsource="" >But around three weeks after undergoing neurosurgery, the former child star developed a chest infection and her condition deteriorated 'rapidly'.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Miss Zavaroni, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >35, was admitted to intensive care but died </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >weighing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >less than </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >four </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >stones </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >with her family by her side. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Consultant neurosurgeon Brian Simpson </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >said the singer, who had suffered from anorexia for more than 20 years, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >had been 'very, very keen indeed to have the operation'. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >He added: </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'She had taken a drugs overdose shortly before then and expressed the view that If she couldn't have the operation, or if it was not successful, then she would kill herself.'
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >Scots-born Miss </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Zavaroni </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >- who shot to fame in the Seventies ITV talent show </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Opportunity Knocks </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >- had been living in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a council flat </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire.
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >Mr Simpson said she had told him </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'she had learned to live with her anorexia and felt she was in a kind of equilibrium with it'. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'But she said she could not live with the increasing torment and suffering from the depressive illness,' </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >he added. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'She felt de-personalised.' </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >After the 90-minute operation had taken place on September 7 at University of Wales Hospital, Cardiff, she was doing very well, said Mr Simpson, and even talking of returning to showbusiness. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'She asked me if I thought there was any chance she would get back on the stage. She was talking about her family </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >about her future.' </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Simpson told the inquest in Cardiff </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he had carried out 36 similar operations </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >- using keyhole surgery to partly interrupt the nerve pathways that control emotions - and </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was surprised </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >by </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >onset </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >of a chest infection. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'It surprised everybody because at that stage she was getting better,' </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >he said.
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Pathologist Dr James Neill gave </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >cause of Miss Zavaroni's death on October 1 as bronchial pneumonia.
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >He added that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >her </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >chronic </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >emaciated condition would have made it more difficult for her immune system to fight off infection.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Miss Zavaroni's </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >60-year-old </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >father Victor </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >asked </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >why surgeons had not waited to operate until his daughter had put on more weight. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Mr Simpson said a brain scan confirmed that the procedure had been successful. He did not believe her weight had been crucial to her contracting pneumonia. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >But he did acknowledge that her malnourished state made it more difficult for her body to fight Infection. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Recording a verdict of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >death </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >by </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >natural causes, coroner Dr Lawrence Addicott said: 'On the evidence we have heard, it does not link the operation with bronchial pneumonia which was the cause of death.' </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >After the hearing, Lena's father and sister </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Carla, 37, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >left the inquest in a distressed state, insisting that the operation, known as a capsulotomy, was the cause of her death.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Carla </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >I cannot understand the verdict. I don't see how you cannot link the operation with Lena's death.' </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Later, University Hospital issued a statement 'to clarify important points'.
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >It said: </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'The operation was not for anorexia. There is no operation for anorexia. It was performed to try to relieve the considerable suffering caused by her severe depressive illness which had not responded to any other treatment.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >'The operation was not a lobotomy, neither was it experimental. Physically, it was a relatively minor procedure and Miss Zavaroni came through it without difficulty. More than three weeks later, she developed a chest infection which tragically overwhelmed her.'
