<New PAsource="" >A SEX killer who mutilated a young mother was last night facing questions over a string of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >unsolved </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >murders.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Lorry driver </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >David Smith </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >raped and murdered </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Amanda Walker </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >before slashing her body with a knife and dumping it in a shallow grave.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >But the Old Bailey jury was never told that Smith had stood trial at the same court for the Ripper-style murder of another woman - and had walked free amid warnings that he would strike again.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >They were also barred from hearing how 43-year-old Smith apparently confessed to the killing while awaiting trial for Amanda's murder.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >After his arrest, Smith's description and a dossier on the brutal killing were circulated to every police force in the UK. Last night, several of them were urgently requesting more information as they tried to crack </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >unsolved </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >cases.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Amanda</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, 21, who came from Leeds and had a young son, was picked up by Smith in a red light district of west London, just four weeks after she turned to prostitution.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Smith </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >drove her to the </New>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Wisley, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >then raped and murdered her. </New>
<New PAsource="" >He mutilated the lower part of her body with a knife before calmly drinking two cans of lager and returning to the home he shared with his mother in Hampton, Middlesex. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Recorder of London Michael Hyam told Smith: "You killed her to satisfy your perverted sexual obsession. You are without pity and without remorse."
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >Smith was traced when Amanda's clothes, stained with blood from his lip she split in the struggle to save her life, were found at the spot. One of his fingerprints was on her handbag.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >He was sent to Highdown Prison in Surrey, where he admitted the killing to fellow sex offender Stephen </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Williams. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >But </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Williams </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was barred for legal reasons from saying how </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Smith </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >also apparently confessed to killing </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sarah Crump.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sarah, 33, was found murdered in Southall, </Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >Smith walked free after his lawyers criticised the detective who ran the murder inquiry.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sarah's mother Pat Rhodes said </Verbatim>
