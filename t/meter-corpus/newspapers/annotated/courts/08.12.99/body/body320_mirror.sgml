<New PAsource="" >I WATCHED shambling 19stone giant </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >David Smith </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >shuffle out of the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Old Bailey </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >six years ago - a free man. </New>
<New PAsource="" >He had just been cleared of the murder many people were convinced he'd committed.</New>


<New PAsource="" >I shared the view that he had killed prostitute Sarah Crump and knew he would murder again. I just didn't know who. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Now I do. A young mum called Amanda Walker.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Days alter his acquittal in 1999 I decided to confront Smith at home. </New>
<New PAsource="" >His little old mum opened the door, and behind her out of the shadows emerged </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Smith. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >I found it slightly unreal that one of Britain's most dangerous killers was staring me in the face. </New>
<New PAsource="" >I gulped and put it straight to </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Smith: </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >"You raped and murdered </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sarah Crump. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >didn't you?"</New>


<New PAsource="" >"I didn't touch her," he mumbled in his slow, deep voice, avoiding my gaze.</New>


<New PAsource="" >"You know you did it," I continued. "The jury didn't hear about your past. You are a violent rapist, aren't you?"</New>


<New PAsource="" >"I've had problems with women in the past," he stuttered. "They make things up about me."</New>


<New PAsource="" >Questioning Smith was a strange experience. This powerful killer, a martial arts expert, cunning and calculating, was unquestionably a mummy's boy. </New>
<New PAsource="" >His demeanour, rather like the nickname Honey Monster which has stuck since childhood, suggested he was nothing more than a misunderstood misfit. That was his trick. </New>
<New PAsource="" >I knew he would rape and murder again. Everyone with knowledge of his past did. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Ridiculously I tried to reason with him. </New>
<New PAsource="" >"You won't go near women again, will you?"</New>


<New PAsource="" >"No, they're bad news," he said, then vowed: "I won't touch a girl ever again."

 For a second I even thought he meant it. </New>
<New PAsource="" >His wrinkly mum, who believed his innocence, and probably still does, had most probably made the same pointless remarks herself.</New>


<New PAsource="" >I returned to the office of the Sunday newspaper where I then worked and wrote about Smith. </New>
<New PAsource="" >I started the story: Remember this face, it belongs to one of the most violent rapists in Britain. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Watching 6ft 4in Smith walk into the sunshine after he was cleared of Sarah's murder was both compelling but terrifying. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Here was a sex-crazed psychopath ambling past me to catch the bus home. </New>
<New PAsource="" >A modern-day Jack the Ripper free to do as he pleased.</New>


<New PAsource="" >I thought at the time: "This could only happen in Britain." </New>
<New PAsource="" >As far I was concerned, Smith was 100 per cent guilty of the charge. </New>
<New PAsource="" >But thanks to his brilliant QC Ronnie Thwaites - affable outside court, brutally incisive inside - Smith walked away from a life sentence. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Smith was helped by the fact that the jury didn't hear, in the supposed interests of Justice, about his previous attacks.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Like his rape of a young mother in front of her children. For that evil crime in 1978 he was given only a four-year jail sentence. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Then there was his conviction in 1987 for kidnapping a woman in the back of his mini-cab. </New>
<New PAsource="" >She escaped a far worse fate by kicking out the windows and fleeing. A two-year suspended sentence was his meagre punishment. </New>
<New PAsource="" >A year later he escaped jail because a vice girl he attacked with a knife was too scared to give evidence. </New>
<New PAsource="" >And 17 days before Sarah died in 1991 he was acquitted of trying to murder another prostitute.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Sarah's mum Pat Rhodes was devastated her daughter's killer was freed. </New>
<New PAsource="" >"She was a lovely girl," Pat told me between tears. "I know he did it."</New>


<New PAsource="" >The jury was spared seeing the photos of Sarah's body. She was disembowelled and had her breasts cut off.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Det insp Jill McTigue, who led the investigation into Smith, knew It was only a matter of time before he would strike again. She told me: "He is the most dangerous man I have ever had anything to do with. He is not a normal human being and has the potential to be a serial killer."</New>


<New PAsource="" >Following his acquittal, Smith wasted little time immersing himself in his favourite pastimes, prostitution and sado-masochistic sex.</New>


<New PAsource="" >He led a double life, working by day as a lorry driver near Heathrow and spending the nights running his own escort agency. In his spare time he preyed on vulnerable women for perverted kicks. </New>
<New PAsource="" >His lust for murder was always going to return. It did so on the night of April 24.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Smith went to a fetish party, complete with dungeon, in Ilford, Essex. </New>
<New PAsource="" >He paid £110 and spent an hour in the steam room with a redhead. </New>
<New PAsource="" >There was no sexual contact, even though they were almost naked. Smith scared her by saying he could kill in seconds. </New>
<New PAsource="" >He hurt her by gripping her hand and then boasted that he did not feel pain himself. </New>
<New PAsource="" >When he left he admitted "feeling randy" and drove off to find a prostitute.</New>


<New PAsource="" >That person was Amanda Walker, a six-stone mum from Leeds with a two-year-old son. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Her fate was sealed when Smith picked her up near Paddington Station. </New>
<New PAsource="" >He bound her hands, repeatedly raped her and mutilated her body before burying it at Wisley, Surrey. </New>
<New PAsource="" >But she managed to split his lip, making his blood drip on her bra. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Smith was arrested when police found her clothes smeared with his blood less than a mile from his home. </New>
<New PAsource="" >They also found his fingerprint on her handbag. 

And he admitted killing her to another prisoner while on remand.</New>
