<Verbatim PAsource="" >A LORRY driver </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >jailed for the sadistic murder of a prostitute yesterday may be a second </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Yorkshire Ripper</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, police believe. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >David Smith</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, who has a long history of appalling sexual violence, is thought to have preyed on women all over Britain in a copy of Peter Sutcliffe's crimes.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Smith, 43, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was nicknamed </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The Honey Monster </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Lurch </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >by workmates because of his </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >6ft 3in, 18</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >st </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >bulk. </New>
<New PAsource="" >But his harmless appearance hid an obsession with sado-masochistic sex and the exploits of the fictional Hannibal Lecter and some of Britain's most notorious real-life killers. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Smith </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >cleared of </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >one murder </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >six years ago </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >- although detectives are convinced he was guilty - </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and he Is to be questioned over a string of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >other unsolved </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >killings.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >He </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >finally </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >jailed for life </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday after an </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Old Bailey </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >jury found him guilty of murdering </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >21-year-old Amanda Walker </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and dumping </Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >in the grounds of </Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Wisley, Surrey, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >last April.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Smith </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >had picked up Miss Walker, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a young mother from </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Leeds </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who had been a prostitute for just </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >four weeks, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >central </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >London. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >He 'mummified' her in cling film before having sex with her and then knifing her. </New>
<New PAsource="" >He stuffed leaves into her mouth to stifle her screams. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Miss Walker</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >'s </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >body was not found for more than a month. </New>
<New PAsource="" >But </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Smith </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >had already been arrested - her clothing had been found near his home and </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >DNA </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >tests linked him to it.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The Recorder of London Judge Michael Hyam, told Smith: 'Anyone who has heard what you did to that unfortunate young woman must have been horrified and revolted. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >It is evident that you killed her to satisfy your perverted sexual </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >obsessions and that </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >you are </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >a man </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >without pity </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and without </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >remorse. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >In my judgement, you are </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >extremely dangerous to women and are likely to remain so.'</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >In </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >July </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >1993, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >amid allegations of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >police incompetence </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and malpractice, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Smith was cleared </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >murdering </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >vice girl </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sarah Crump, 33, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who was found horrifically mutilated in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >her Southall </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >flat. </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >Last night her </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >mother Pat Rhodes, said: 'I said at the time that Smith would kill again </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and he has. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >We are very relieved at this result. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Nothing will bring Sarah back, we know that, but we </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >felt </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >there has been unfinished business while Smith has been free. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >My condolences go to the family of Amanda Walker.'</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Smith's </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >details have now been passed to Operation Enigma - the programme set up to determine whether serial killers are Involved in the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >unsolved </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >murders of more than 200 </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >women. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Among the killings to be looked at will be that of Maria Requena, 27, whose body was found in plastic bin bags at a country park in Leigh, Greater Manchester.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Police have also reopened flies on Liverpool vice girl Linda Donaldson, 31, whose mutilated body was found less than three miles away in 1988. Other cases involve Glasgow prostitutes Jackie Gallacher, 26, and Tracey Wylde, 21.</New> 


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Smith's </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >work could have taken him </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >all over the country, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and officers will try to track his movements. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Police believe his lust to mutilate and kill dates back to the failure of his short lived marriage, when his wife ran off with a lodger. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Smith </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >moved </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >back to his </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >widowed </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >mother's home in suburban Hampton, West London, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >led a classic double life. </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >was polite, softly spoken </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >conscientious, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >working mostly in minicabs or as a truck driver. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >But </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >at </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >night he moved In a </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >sordid </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >world of prostitutes and sado-masochism. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >He </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >ran his own escort agency - hiring girls out </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Wisley Common, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >a notorious meeting place for </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >sex.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >One senior detective said: 'He liked to appear inoffensive, a bit slow and stupid, but we found a calculating sex monster who enjoyed controlling and hurting women. He has spent his life venting his anger and frustration.'</New> 


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Smith </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >carried out </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >his first </New>

<New PAsource="" >to a beauty spot </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and locked </Rewrite>
