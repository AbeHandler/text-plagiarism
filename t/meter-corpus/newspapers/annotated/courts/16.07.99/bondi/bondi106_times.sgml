<Verbatim PAsource="" >A jury yesterday cleared Martin, 25, of murder, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >but found </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >him guilty of grievous bodily harm.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hagland's parents, Brian and Shirley and his two sisters wept </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >verdict </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was given at </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >New South Wales Supreme Court. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Outside court, his fiancee,  Connie Casey a property developer from London, said </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Miss Casey, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who witnessed the attack </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in September 1996, said: "Brian was a big part of all our lives. I was with him for seven years and I haven't been able to move on since it happened.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >"I have struggled for nearly three years to reach this point and it has taken	everything inside me, mentally, physically and emotionally, to get here. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >I'd </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >hoped with my evidence that we'd get murder or at least manslaughter, but that wasn't meant to be. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >I hope the judge gives the maximum sentence possible. Brian has been taken away and nothing can replace him. He was a true original</New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >".</Verbatim> 


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Miss Casey, 27, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hagland, 28, from Cricklewood. northwest London, had been in Australia for eight months and were about to leave for New Zealand when the attack happened.</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hagland died in hospital.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >While admitting that he was drunk at the time, Martin told the court that he was in fear of his life. He said he made a lewd remark about Miss Casey but then acted to save himself from being injured by Mr Hagland when they began wrestling on the road.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >He </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >denied that he had been </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >aware of the approaching bus.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >He told the jury </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he was in pain from a bite wound inflicted by Mr Hagland and was 'just trying to get him away'.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >There had been fears that the murder trial would end in a retrial. </New>
<New PAsource="" >The </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >jury </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >of three women and nine men </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >took </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >more than a week </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to reach their verdict.</Rewrite>


<New PAsource="" >The case was complicated by inconclusive scientific evidence and a lack of witnesses of the moment when Mr Hagland fell under the bus. Miss Casey was inside a nearby restaurant telephoning for help.</New>


<New PAsource="" >She spoke yesterday of her relief that the case was over. "There was always the dread that it was going to be a hung jury and that we'd have to come back and do it all over again and I'm very pleased that we don't." she said.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Miss Casey and Mr Hagland had been planning to emigrate so Australia at the time he was killed and she said that the tragedy had not changed her mind.</New>


<New PAsource="" >"I love Australia, it hasn't changed my view. Brian and I wanted to live here, we wanted to emigrate and if I could, I would. The last time I saw him alive was here, and that's what I want to keep in my head."</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Earlier, Judge Caroline </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Simpson </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had expressed her personal sympathy for </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hagland's </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >friends and relatives. </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >'The court is not oblivious to what you have suffered. For my own personal part, I have every sympathy with you. I would like to convey my condolences to each of you - the cold atmosphere of the courtroom is not always truly reflective of the feelings and emotions of those participating."</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Martin was found guilty of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm by strangling and his friend, Sean Cushman, 25, was convicted of being an accessory after the fact of the assault at the same trial. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Martin faces a maximum sentence of 25 years. </New>
