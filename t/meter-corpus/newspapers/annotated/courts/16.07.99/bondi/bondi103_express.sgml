<Verbatim PAsource="" >my evidence </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >we'd get murder or at least manslaughter, but that wasn't meant to be," she </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said.
</Rewrite>

<New PAsource="" >"I hope the judge gives the maximum sentence possible. Brian has been taken away and nothing can replace him. He was a true original."

<Rewrite PAsource="" >But </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >from his London home Brian's uncle Ron Hagland said:
