<Verbatim PAsource="" >Ms Casey </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said she and Mr Hagland had just alighted from </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a bus </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >when </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a stranger, Aaron Lee Martin, 25, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >stormed up to them with staring eyes and began punching and kicking </Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Although </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Martin </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was charged with murder, the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >jury </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >at the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >New South Wales Supreme Court found him guilty </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of the </Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >The jurors took </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a week </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to decide their verdict.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mr </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hagland's family and Ms Casey, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who travelled from England to testify, were visibly </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >shocked at the verdict. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I had hoped that on my evidence we'd get murder or at least manslaughter," </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Ms Casey </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >told reporters. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >The dead man's parents </Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Ms Casey added.</Rewrite>


<New PAsource="" >Martin pleaded not guilty to all the charges, claiming he acted in self-defence. </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >He said the fight began after he made remarks </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >about Ms Casey's breasts, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >he was </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >not </Rewrite>
