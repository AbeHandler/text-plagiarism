<Verbatim PAsource="" >But after </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >six days of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >deliberations, a jury at the New South Wales state supreme court cleared Martin of murder, </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hagland. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Cushman was </Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >verdict. </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >Asked what she had wanted from the jury, she said: "I wanted murder.</New>


<New PAsource="" >"I hope the judge puts the maximum sentence possible. Brian has been taken away and nothing can ever replace him. He was a true original."</New>


<New PAsource="" >Miss Casey, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a 27-year-old </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >London </Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >before Mr Hagland's death, </Rewrite>

<New PAsource="" >The three years since the incident had taken "everything inside me - mentally, physically and emotionally" to get through, she said. She plans to return home within the next few days.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Asked about the effect on the Hagland family, who had rushed from the courtroom into a waiting taxi, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Miss Casey said: "</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Everybody's just </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >torn apart. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Brian was a big part of all our lives. I was with Brian for seven years and I haven't been able to move on since it happened.'</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >She had watched on in horror the night her fiancé died, trying to stop the fight by hitting Martin so hard with her handbag that a bottle of vitamin pills inside it smashed.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Martin </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >attacked the British tourist for no reason, trying to strangle </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >him </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >him </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >against a </Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >told the jury he did not push </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hagland </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >into </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the bus </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >deliberately or intend to kill him. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >He said he was trying to protect himself </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >against the bigger and stronger Briton </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hagland </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >fell in front of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the bus.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >After the jury had been dismissed, the Hagland family stood up to leave the court. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Justice Carolyn Simpson </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >took the unusual step of addressing them directly. </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >"I have every sympathy with you but I would not like you to think that the sometimes alienating atmosphere of the courtroom means I am not aware of what you have been through </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >I hope this ordeal is over and you will be able to return to your country and rebuild your lives."</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >from his London home </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that his </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >family would be disappointed. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"For them to find Martin guilty of just GBH as if he had given someone a black eye, is unbelievable."</Verbatim>
