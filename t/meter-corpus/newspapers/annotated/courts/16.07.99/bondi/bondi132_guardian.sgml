<Rewrite PAsource="" >The family </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >of a British </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >tourist who was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >killed </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >as he strolled </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >with his fiancée </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >on </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Bondi Beach </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >spoke of their anguish yesterday as </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >his attacker was cleared of murder.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >The </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >jury at the New South Wales supreme court in Sydney </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >took </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >more than a week </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to decide that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Aaron Lee Martin, 25, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >not guilty of </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >murder </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >or manslaughter of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >postman Brian Hagland, 28 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >- despite </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >throttling him and throwing him in front of a bus </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >- but </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >guilty of grievous bodily harm. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >The conviction carries a maximum 25 year sentence, hut police in Sydney last night said Martin was unlikely to spend this long in jail.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >As the verdict was announced, Mr Hagland's parents, Brian and Shirley, and two sisters wept, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >their sobbing reverberating through the courtroom from the public gallery from where they have watched the trial for the past six weeks.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Outside the court they were too distraught to speak, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >but </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hagland's fiancée, Connie Casey said: I had hoped that on my evidence we'd get murder or at least manslaughter, but that wasn't meant to be." </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Ms Casey, 27, who was telephoning for help at the moment Mr Hagland died </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >on September 7, 1996, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >added: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >I have struggled for nearly three years to reach this point, and it has taken everything inside me mentally, physically and emotionally.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Brian was a big part of all our lives, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and everyone has been just torn apart by this. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >I was with him for seven years, and I haven't been able to move on since it happened. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >He's been taken away, and nothing can replace him,</New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Ms Casey, a property developer, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >from Kilburn, north London, said she hoped the judge, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who has not yet fixed a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >date </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >sentencing, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >would give the maximum penalty.</New>


<New PAsource="" >She was relieved the trial was over. "There was always the dread that it was going to be a hung jury and that we'd have to come back and do it all again".</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >In </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >London, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mr Hagland's </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >uncle, Ron Hagland, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of Stoke Newington, spoke of the family's disappointment at the verdict. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Of course I'm disappointed, but I'm more disappointed someone so Innocent should be robbed of his life in such an appalling way.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Apparently the autopsy said his injuries from the fight were the cause of death. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >All right, the bus finished him off, but the police were satisfied by two autopsies which proved he would have died as a result of the injuries anyway.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >"For them to find Martin guilty of just GBH as If he had </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >just </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >given someone a black eye is unbelievable </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >- GBH might be a fair outcome if two people are just involved in a bit of a fight, but Brian was killed and he was innocent.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >"For my part, seeing him [Martin] banged up would not bring satisfaction. It should be an eye for eye".</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >The court heard that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hagland </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Ms Casey had been in Australia for eight months and were </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >soon </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to leave for New Zealand before returning to England. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >They had had </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >drinks with former colleagues from the Australian trade commission </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >when the drunken </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >stranger</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, who was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"fired up with adrenaline", staring wildly and moving aggressively, approached them. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Martin knocked down Mr Hagland and began choking him on the road </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >before shoving him </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in the path of </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >bus, causing </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >extensive </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >injuries, the prosecution said.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >But </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >Martin, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who admitted being </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >drunk, told the court he was in fear of his life </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and wrestled with </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hagland </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >only to defend himself after making a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >lewd remark about Ms Casey's breasts. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Denying he was aware of the approaching bus, he told the jury he was in pain </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >after </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Hagland </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >bit him - and pushed him </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"to get him away". </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Martin's friend Sean Leigh Cushman, 25, was </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >convicted </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >of being an accessory </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the assault.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >After the verdict </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Justice Carolyn Simpson </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >expressed her sympathy </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to the Hagland </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >family and Ms Casey</Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" > - and defended the Australian judicial system.</New>


<New PAsource="" >"The court is not oblivious to what you have suffered," the judge said. "For my part, I have every sympathy with you. I would like to convey my condolences to each of you. The cold atmosphere of the courtroom is not always reflective of those feelings and emotions of those participating".</New>
