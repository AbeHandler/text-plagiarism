<Rewrite PAsource="" >of tragic Brit </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Brian Hagland </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >broke down in tears of despair yesterday after the man accused of murdering him </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >sensationally </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >cleared.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >After more than a </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >week's deliberation, an Australian </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >jury </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >did not even find the drunken thug guilty of manslaughter.</Rewrite>


<New PAsource="" >As the full impact of the verdict sank in. Brian's devastated mum Shirley collapsed in uncontrollable sobs.</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Dad </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Brian</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, their </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >two </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >daughters </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >and the woman who had watched her fiancé die - girlfriend </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Connie Casey</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" > - all broke down in tears too.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >The Sydney </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Jury </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Aaron Lee Martin, 25, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >guilty </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >only </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >of grievous bodily harm.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >That was despite an </Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >28-year-old </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >former London postman </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had caused his </Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Connie </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Brian</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >a cousin of EastEnders star Sid Owen, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >were returning from a party in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >1996 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >when </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Martin </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >attacked.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >As they got </Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >famous </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Bondi Beach</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, the Australian </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >and a pal </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >staggered toward </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >them</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >.</Rewrite>



<New PAsource="" >Connie, 27, says </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Martin made a </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >crude </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >remark about </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >breasts</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, then launched into a brutal assault.</Rewrite>


<New PAsource="" >Connie, who has been forced to relive the experience three times during the trial, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >told how </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Martin </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"fired up with adrenaline' staring wildly and moving aggressively.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >He knocked down Brian </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and after more punches </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >began </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >strangling </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >him</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Horrified </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Connie </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >raced to call for </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >help</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >but seconds after she left </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the prosecution </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >say </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Martin </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >pushed </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >her fiancé into </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >an oncoming </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >bus</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Brian died </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of his </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >injuries </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >shortly afterwards </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in hospital.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Connie - </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who has been </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in Australia </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >with Brian's mum, dad and sisters </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >Michelle, 36, and Jane, 31, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >six weeks </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >- made an emotional statement after the verdict. </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >She said:</Rewrite>


<New PAsource="" >'I have struggled for nearly three years to reach this point and it has taken every thing inside me mentally, physically, emotionally to get here. </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >I'd </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >hoped </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >with </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >my evidence </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >we'd get murder or at least manslaughter, but that wasn't meant to be. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >I hope the judge gives the maximum sentence possible - Brian has been taken away and nothing can replace him, he was a true original.'</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Brian's </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >parents, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Shirley, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >60, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >and Brian, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >61, were too devastated to make a statement. </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >But his </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >uncle Ron </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >summed up their dismay at his </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >London home </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >- revealing the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >whole family </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had been shattered by the court's </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >decision</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >He said: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Apparently the autopsy said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Brian's </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >injuries from the fight were the cause of death before the bus </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had even </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >hit him.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >"For </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the jury </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to find </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Martin </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >guilty of just GBH as if he had given someone a black eye is </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >just </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >unbelievable,"</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >But there was still some relief among the family that the trial had finally come to an end. There were fears that the jury of three women and nine men might be unable to reach a verdict and there would have to be a retrial.</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Instead, they finally came to their decision after eight days.</Rewrite>


<New PAsource="" >Connie, of Cricklewood, North London, added: "There was always the dread that it was going to be a hung jury and that we'd have to come back and do it all over again.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >"</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >I am very pleased that we don't. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Brian was a big part of our lives, I was with him seven years and haven't been able to move on since it happened ."</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Connie told how she and Brian planned to emigrate to Australia - and said the tragedy had not changed her mind.</New>


<New PAsource="" >She went on: -"I love Australia. It hasn't changed my view. Brian and I wanted to live here, we wanted to emigrate, and If I could, I would.</New>


<New PAsource="" >"But I'll always want to come back, I'll never forget I've left my memories of Brian here. The last time I saw him alive was here, and that's what I want to keep in my head.</New>


<New PAsource="" >"He's been here all the time. I talk to him all the time, I know people think I'm mad but I'm always talking to him.</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Earlier </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the judge, Justice Carolyn Simpson, offered her condolences to </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Connie and Brian's family. </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >She said: "The court is not oblivious to what you have suffered, for my own part I have every sympathy with you.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >"</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >I would like to convey my condolences to each of you - the cold atmosphere of the court room is not always truly reflective of the feelings and emotions of those participating.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I hope this ordeal is over for you and you are able to return to your country and rebuild your lives."</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >It will be at least six weeks before Martin </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sean Leigh Cushman, 25 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >- found guilty of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >being an accessory </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >- are sentenced. Martin faces a maximum sentence of 25 years.</New>
