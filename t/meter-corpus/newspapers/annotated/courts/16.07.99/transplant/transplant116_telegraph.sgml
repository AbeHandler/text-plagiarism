<Rewrite PAsource="" >The case of Chaye Parker, who persistently refused treatment for anorexia, set a legal precedent for the power of the courts to override the wishes of an individual.
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Her case was the first time a judge decided that not only did behave the power to order her to have treatment - that had been done with anorexic children before - but he could also order her detention under common law.

<Verbatim PAsource="" >treatment </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and insisting that she wanted to die.
</New>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Two years later, however, Miss Parker, 18, is planning to go to university and has fully recovered.
</Rewrite>

<New PAsource="" >She said yesterday: "When I read about the case of this girl who wanted to die rather than have a heart transplant I saw the parallels.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >"I felt for her so much and I just wanted to say to her, 'Don't give up. They are doing this in your best interests. They don't want to hurt you, they want to help you'.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >"When you are 15 or 16 you have so much ahead of you and it would be a pity to give up so easily and never find out what is out there for you."

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Miss Parker, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who has remained anonymous until now, said she felt compelled to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >speak out </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >after hearing how </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >Mr Justice Johnson </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had overruled the 15-year-old 'who said she would rather die than receive a heart transplant.

<New PAsource="" >north London, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said: </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >"When the judge ordered that I should have treatment I resented it bitterly. I was so angry and frustrated because I felt, 'Why should he say what should happen to my life'?
</New>

<New PAsource="" >"I kept running away. I felt that because I was a child I wasn't allowed any rights. I found the whole thing unbearable. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >At one point I just didn't care. I was determined it was my life. It was up to me and I didn't want anyone to have power over me.
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >"Now I am so glad. I wouldn't be alive today if they had listened to me. I started getting better and enjoying life again and I realised what happened to me was the right thing. It was the only way they could keep me alive."
</New>

<New PAsource="" >At the time the order was made at the High Court in March 1997, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Miss Parker had eaten </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >just </Rewrite>
