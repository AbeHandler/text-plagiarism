<New PAsource="" >THE dad of the dying girl who refused to have a heart transplant yesterday told how forcing her to have the op was the hardest decision he'd ever made.</New>


<New PAsource="" >He agonised over getting High Court Judge Mr Justice Johnson to order 15-year-old Child M to have the life-saving surgery.</New>


<New PAsource="" >The dad, talking to neighbours in the Ulster town where they live, said:

"It was the hardest decision any father could have to make. But I hope that some day my daughter can bring herself to forgive me.

"I only did it because I love her so much and could not bear it if she had died."</New>


<New PAsource="" >He, his wife, his other daughter and two grandparents are all at the Newcastle hospital where Child M who cannot be named for legal reasons - is recovering after the op.</New> 
<New PAsource="" >The family's local Presbyterian minister said that the village had rallied around the family and raised £3,000 for them to be with her. </New>
<New PAsource="" >He said yesterday: "Her illness came as a terrible shock to the family. I have been visiting them regularly and trying to comfort them. </New>
<New PAsource="" >"They are coping as best they can in very trying circumstances. I speak to the girl's father every day by phone and I know how difficult that decision to take legal action was for them.</New>


<New PAsource="" >"She is a very brave girl from a close-knit and loving family. I am sure that she will pull through. All our prayers are with her and her family".</New>


<New PAsource="" >Neighbours said the girl had been out-going, happy and very popular until falling ill about a month ago. </New>
<New PAsource="" >"It was real shock for all of us," one said yesterday. "Everyone has been talking about it and praying for her. Her father said that she had refused the heart transplant because she was so frightened of the operation.</New>


<New PAsource="" >"He believes she said that she didn't want another person's heart in her body because she was so frightened. </New>
<New PAsource="" >"Everyone here thinks he made the right decision. What father would have done otherwise? We'll all make a great fuss of her when she is better and can't wait to have her home." </New>
