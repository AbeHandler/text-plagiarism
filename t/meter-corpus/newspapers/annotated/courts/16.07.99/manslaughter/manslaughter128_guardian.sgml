<Verbatim PAsource="" >Lee Tate, 23, knocked Seung Jun Lee  to the ground, causing him to fracture his skull on the path, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in his desire to boost his </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'macho image,' the court heard.
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >He then </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >punched and kicked his 30-year-old victim in the face as he lay unconscious in his wife's arms.

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Southwark crown court, Judge George Bathurst-Norman told Tate, who admitted manslaughter </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >but </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was earlier cleared of murder, that his behaviour had been 'simply appalling.'
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >"There could be absolutely no excuse" </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >unprovoked attack, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >which had been launched </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"to boost some kind of macho image. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >It was wholly shameful and despicable that once you had knocked him to the ground you decided to pursue that attack against him the Judge said.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The court heard that Mr </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Seung, who was to read for his </Rewrite>

<New PAsource="" >last August </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >when Tate pushed an empty buggy into his wife's legs.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >When the </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >LSE graduate </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >pulled it away, Tate, from Acton, west London, delivered a punch so hard his victim fell back "like a log"
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >As Mr </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Seung's </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >wife, Nan-Joo, tried to comfort her fatally injured husband, Tate continued to attack him. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >She later told police </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that she begged them:
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >"My husband is dying, please stop".
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Sentencing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Petrie, of Kingston upon Thames, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >attempting to cause grievous bodily harm, the judge said:

"You saw Tate knock Mr Seung to the ground. I am quite satisfied that it must have been very, very clear to you ... that there was no further threat from him yet you couldn't resist the opportunity to pile in and assault him".

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Sentencing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Picard, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >also </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >of Kingston upon Thames, who was convicted of causing actual bodily harm, </Verbatim>
