<Verbatim PAsource="" >A KILLER whose pursuit of a 'macho image' left a Cambridge </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >research student </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >dying on a towpath was jailed for 30 months yesterday.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Lee Tate, 23, knocked his victim to the ground with one punch, causing him to strike his head on the path and </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >fracturing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >his skull. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Then, as Seung Jun Lee, 30, lay unconscious in his sobbing wife's arms, Tate punched and kicked him in the face.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >One of his </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >friends, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Earl Petrie, 24, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Kingston upon Thames, who received 12 months, then 'piled in', also striking the helpless man.</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >
A third </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >accused, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mark Picard, 25, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >also from </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Kingston, attacked one of Mr Lee's friends when he went to the stricken man's aid. He was jailed for three months.
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >At </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Southwark Crown Court, Judge George Bathurst Norman told Tate - who was earlier cleared of murder </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >convicted of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm, and who yesterday admitted manslaughter - that his behaviour had been 'simply appalling'.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The men's Old Bailey trial </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >heard that Mr Lee had been </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >strolling </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >beside the Thames at Kingston </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >with his </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >wife, </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >sister and two friends </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >when Tate pushed an empty buggy into his wife's legs. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >When the Korean-born researcher pulled it away, Tate, from Acton, West London. delivered a single punch that was so hard his victim fell back 'like a log'.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >As Mr Lee's wife, Nan Joo, tried to comfort her fatally injured husband, Tate continued to attack him.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >She later told police: "I said, 'My husband is dying, please stop'.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The judge told Tate that 'there could be absolutely no excuse' for what he did. He had tried to "boost some kind of macho image".
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >"It was wholly shameful and despicable that once you had knocked him to the ground you decided to pursue that attack against him," he added.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The court heard that all three men gave themselves up to police after hearing that Mr Lee, who was </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >studying for </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a PhD at Cambridge, had died in hospital five days after the attack.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The judge backed criticism by Mr Lee's widow </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the way </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >police </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >officers </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >reacted when they first arrived. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I find it greatly disturbing, as do the public as a whole, to find police officers in complete ignorance of events committed and arrive at the scene and reject outright what they have been told by witnesses as to what the position is."
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >He also criticised </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the officers' </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'deplorable' lack of first aid knowledge in not recognising "classic symptoms" of head injuries.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >A Scotland Yard spokesman said the matter was the subject of a Police Complaints Authority investigation. Mr Lee's widow, who was in court, left refusing to comment.
