<Rewrite PAsource="" >while </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >six weeks </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >pregnant.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >A </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >High Court judge </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >heard yesterday how the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >mother of two </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had to wait 40 minutes for an ambulance - </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >26 more than the national average - </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >had stopped breathing </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >when she reached </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >hospital.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >She lost the baby she was carrying and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >suffered </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >such </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >severe memory loss </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that she could not </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >recognise </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the daughter she already had. </Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Her marriage to husband Gary </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >fell apart as a result of the severe brain damage she had suffered. </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >The couple are now divorcing.</New>


<New PAsource="" >In the first case of its kind to reach a full court hearing, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Justice Turner ruled the service had a duty of care to provide an ambulance within a reasonable time. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >He </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >ordered </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >London Ambulance </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Service to pay </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mrs Kent damages of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >£362,377. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Legal experts predicted the ruling could open the floodgates to patients suing for ambulances failing to turn up on time.</New>


<New PAsource="" >The judge told the hearing at Bristol Crown Court that Mrs Kent's condition had been significantly exacerbated by the delay. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'In my judgment a period of not less than 14 minutes was needlessly lost in the process of reaching the claimant's house,' </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >he said.</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >'As will be appreciated, those minutes had a critical effect on the outcome of the case.' </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >The judge said he should have found it 'offensive' and 'inconsistent with concepts of common humanity' if the law was not able to provide a remedy.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Mrs Kent of St Paul's Cray, near Chislehurst, in Kent, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >suffered the asthma attack </Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >She was told to expect it within ten to 15 minutes.</New>


<New PAsource="" >When it failed to arrive, Mrs Kent's husband called again to be told it was on its way and was expected to arrive in seven or eight minutes.</New>


<New PAsource="" >By 4.55pm, the ambulance had still not appeared and with Mrs Kent's condition deteriorating, Dr Griffiths called once more. </New>
<New PAsource="" >When paramedics finally </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >arrived </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >at </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >5.O5pm, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >she was taken to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Queen Mary's Hospital in Sidcup, Kent.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >London Ambulance Service chiefs initially succeeded in having the claim against them struck out by the High Court in London. But the Court of Appeal reversed that decision.</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >After the hearing, an </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >ambulance service </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >spokesman </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said: '</Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The LAS deeply regrets the injuries suffered by Mrs Kent </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and the burden for her and her family of pursuing a claim which was contested.</New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >He said </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >existing law </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >suggested </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >that the duty of care owed by </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >ambulance </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >service </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to the public did not extend to the guaranteed time of arrival. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'The LAS will study the court's ruling and consider its implications carefully' </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >he added.</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Kent </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >also brought a civil action against </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >two </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >GPs - Dr Griffiths and Dr Marian Roberts </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >claiming they wrongly advised her on medication. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >That case was thrown out by Mr Justice Turner. </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >A spokesman for the Department of Health said it was 'speculation' that the case would encourage others to seek compensation. 'This is one case,' she said. 'Each is judged on its merits.'</New>
