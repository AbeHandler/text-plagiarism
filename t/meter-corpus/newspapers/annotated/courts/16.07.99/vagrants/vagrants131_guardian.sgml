<Verbatim PAsource="" >A 28-year nightmare which began when "a perfectly normal wife and mother" found her husband dead in bed beside her came within hope of an end </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday.
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mary Druhan, now in her 50s, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >walked free from </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the appeal court </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >after spending </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >10 years </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in prison </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >for a double murder. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Three judges </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >agreed </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >conviction was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >unsafe.
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >The deaths occurred in what was described in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >court </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >as "the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >nether world" </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >alcoholic </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >vagrancy into which the death of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >her husband </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >plunged her.
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Her first words, as she was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >greeted by </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >weeping </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >members of her family </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >after her discharge, were: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I'm free, I'm free, I'm free".
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Then she said: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I would like a nice cup of tea and a Cornetto. It was hot in there."
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Asked how she felt, she said:

"I don't feel anything. I feel numb."
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mrs Druhan's case was first raised seven years ago by the </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >Channel 4 </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >programme </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Trial and Error, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >for which the result is a triumph.
</New>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >As a young woman she came </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to England from Ireland to work as a private nurse. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >She married her husband John in the 1950s and had two daughters. John died in April 1971.</New>

<New PAsource="" >
Trial and Error's producer, Steve Haywood, said outside the court that Mrs Druhan's fate showed "how tenuous can be the hold we all have on what we believe to be reality.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Until John's death, she was virtually teetotal. After he died, she continued to lay a place for him at table.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >She began drinking without anyone knowing. This intensified. She lost her home and her job.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >She </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >lived in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >squats </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and derelict houses, </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >searching the riverbanks in her home town, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >every morning for dregs of beer in discarded cans.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >In 1989 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >she was convicted of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >murdering </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >two alcoholics, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Richard Duddie and Kenneth Challenger, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >by causing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a fire </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a squat </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >at </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Kingston. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >She denied being </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the house.
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >She lost her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >appeal </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >against conviction </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in 1990. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >But last year </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the criminal cases review commission referred </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >her case </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >back to the court.
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >In the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >hearing </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >which led to her discharge yesterday, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >her counsel, Lady Kennedy, said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >one of the trial </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >witnesses </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >against her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >had subsequently been linked to two other fires </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >derelict houses. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >The other </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was dead.
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Both </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >had given markedly different accounts. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Lady Kennedy </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >spoke of the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"slippery" quality of evidence given by people with fragile and dysfunctional personalities.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Their consciousness of time is wholly unreliable. Days melt into days and a sense of real time doesn't exist for them."
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Yesterday </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Lord Bingham said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a third witness's </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >evidence </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a drunken pub scene before the </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Kingston </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >fire </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >inconsistent. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >His </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >criminal record for forgery and shoplifting </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had not been disclosed at the trial. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >This </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >deprived </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mrs Druhan's </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >defence of an important </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >chance </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to undermine his credibility.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Outside court her solicitor, Kate Akester, said: "We will be putting in an application for compensation as quickly as possible." Family members said that they were "delighted and in a state of shock".
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >Mr Haywood said: "She has not drunk in prison, although alcohol is known to be available there.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >"Now she is going out into the world with a support structure around her."
</New>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Asked </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >about her future, Mrs Druhan said: "I have not given it much thought".
