<Verbatim PAsource="" >A "LADY of the manor" was jailed for nine months </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday after brandishing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a loaded shotgun </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >at a female bailiff and asking police to remove her because she was "polluting the atmosphere" with her "cheap scent".</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >As </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Yvonne Amor, 53, was led </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to the cells at </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Truro Crown Court, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >her daughters screamed: "She did not do it!". </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Amor </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >told her children </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >in refined tones: </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Remember you're an Amor!"</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >When Amor saw the bailiffs in the hall of her 17th-century country home she fetched a double-barrelled shotgun.</New>


<New PAsource="" >She then telephoned the police and told the operator:
"I will get violent if you don't remove them. There is this silly cow who stinks of a cheap scent. She is polluting the atmosphere. She stinks like a tart. I am surprised these people have not had their faces filled in years ago by people far less civilised than I."</New>


<New PAsource="" >The trial heard Amor's husband Richard had been fined for traffic offences but had ignored warning letters. </New>
<New PAsource="" >In June 1998, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Jayne Thompson and Simon Nutt </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >were sent to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Wetherham Manor </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >near St Tudy in north Cornwall </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to seize goods </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >worth </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >£433.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >The court heard that Amor stormed into the hall and told the bailiffs to "Get out of my house" before getting the shotgun.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Mrs Thompson said: "It was pointed at me. I thought I was going to be shot. Mrs Amor kept referring to my perfume and my weight and calling me a whore. I was absolutely terrified."</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >The court heard that when police handcuffed </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Amor, her daughter Sophia waved a hockey stick at police. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Her other daughter Charlotte, 15, was said to have tackled a police inspector.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Amor, an unsuccessful Conservative candidate in the 1997 Cornwall county council elections, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >gun </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had remained </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"broken", </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >that she had never pointed it at anyone, and had fetched it to protect herself.</New>


<New PAsource="" >She admitted abusing the bailiffs. "I do have a slightly florid turn of phrase when I get going," she said. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I'm sure I was extremely offensive."</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >She </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was convicted on two charges of threatening the bailiffs with intent to cause them to believe unlawful violence would be used against them. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >She was acquitted of assaulting Mrs Thompson.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Judge Jeremy Griggs </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >behaviour </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had been </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >disgraceful. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"The fact that you are the lady that lives in </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >manor house does not give you any </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >special </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >privileges".</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Nick O'Brien, defending, said the family were in desperate financial trouble. He added: "She has found it very stressful to be tried in public, especially with certain neighbours sitting in court with whom she is on bad terms."</New>


<New PAsource="" >There was little sympathy for Amor in St Tudy. One villager said "There will be a few glasses raised in celebration at this news."</New>


<New PAsource="" >The Amors were in dispute with villagers over plans to open their garden to the public. They advertised the gardens but warned tourists not to ask for directions in the village because they would "only be misled".</New>


<New PAsource="" >After his wife was sentenced Richard Amor, 68, said: "The one thing keeping her going is the thought that the bailiffs will burn in eternal damnation."</New>
