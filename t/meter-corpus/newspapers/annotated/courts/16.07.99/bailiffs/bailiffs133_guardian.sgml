<Rewrite PAsource="" >house to try to recover a £180 debt incurred by her husband </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >for traffic offences.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Rushing upstairs, she grabbed a double barrelled shotgun </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and ordered the terrified man and woman to leave her property, </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >complaining that the female bailiff was polluting the atmosphere with cheap scent.</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >When police arrived </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >at the £750,000 house in the village of St Tudy </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >near Bodmin, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Cornwall, </New>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Passing sentence, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Judge Jeremy Griggs </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >lady of the manor </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >behaviour </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had been </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >disgraceful. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >She had produced the weapon when she was extremely angry </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and had set out to prevent the court bailiffs going about their business.</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >"The fact that you are the lady </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >lives in </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >manor house does not give you any </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Your behaviour that day was disgraceful. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The example you set to your family was dishonourable </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >As she was led </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Amor </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >called out to her daughters: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Remember you are an Amor." </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >During the four day trial in May the court heard that Amor's husband, Richard, had ignored warning letters after he had been fined for traffic offences.</New>


<New PAsource="" >In June 1998, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >bailiffs Jayne Thompson and Simon Nutt </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >went to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Wetherham Manor </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >in St Tudy </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to recover the debt.</Rewrite>


<New PAsource="" >When the door was opened by the Amors' 20-year-old daughter, Sophia, Amor told them to "sod off".</New>


<New PAsource="" >Amor fetched her shotgun </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >then made two emergency calls to the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >police, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >recordings of which were played to the jury. </New>
<New PAsource="" >She told the operator she would </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >get violent </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >if police did not remove the bailiffs.</New>


<New PAsource="" >"There is this silly cow who stinks of a cheap scent. I want her out, she is polluting the atmosphere. I am very, very angry and I want them removed. She stinks like a tart."</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Amor</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, who denied the charges, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >insisted that her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >gun </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had remained in the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >broken </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >position </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >and that she had only fetched it to protect herself while she called the police.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Richard Amor said the case against his wife was founded on a lie. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >sentence </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >was </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the culmination of a nightmare.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >"The only thing keeping her going at this moment is the thought that the two bailiffs who bore false witness against her should die before admitting their lies and they will burn in eternal damnation," he said.</New>
