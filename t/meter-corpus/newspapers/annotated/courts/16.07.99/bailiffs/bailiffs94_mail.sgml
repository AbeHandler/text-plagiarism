<New PAsource="" >POISE and breeding went out the window the day the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >bailiffs </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >came to call on the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >lady of the manor.
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >What had begun as the relatively minor matter of </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >her husband's </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >unpaid parking </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >fines </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >ended with </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Yvonne Amor </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >being dragged off in handcuffs after greeting </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the bailiffs </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >with a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >loaded double-barrelled shotgun </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and a torrent of foul-mouthed abuse.
</New>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >One </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >daughter </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >was warned off by police with CS gas </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >after </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >she </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >brandished </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a hockey stick at officers </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >- and the family reputation was left in tatters.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Humiliation was complete yesterday </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >when </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Amor's behaviour </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was branded by a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >judge </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >as </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'disgraceful' </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >after a jury </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >convicted </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >on two </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >counts </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >of threatening the bailiffs </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >with a gun. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >She </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was jailed for nine months </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >as she was led </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >away </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >her daughters screamed from the public gallery: 'She did not do it!' </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Their 53-year-old mother </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >turned to them and in refined tones boomed across the court: </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'Remember you are an Amor.' 
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >The jury at Truro Crown Court heard how Mrs Amor's husband Richard a 88-year-old retired army officer, was fined £180 by magistrates for traffic offences but ignored payment demands. </New>
<New PAsource="" >In June 1998 </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >bailiffs Jayne Thompson and Simon Nutt </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >drove up the quarter-mile drive to </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Wetherham Manor</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, set in extensive grounds outside the village of St Tudy in north Cornwall, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to recover the debt, </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >which by then had risen to </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >£433. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Mrs Amor's daughter Sophia, 20, answered the door but when the bailiffs stepped inside her mother stormed downstairs yelling 'Sod off. Get out of my house.' </New>
<New PAsource="" >She disappeared and returned moments later </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >brandishing a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >shotgun, Mrs Thompson told the court.
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >'It was pointed at myself,' she sobbed. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'I thought I was going to be shot. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >I thought about my children. Mrs Amor kept referring to my perfume and my weight, calling me a whore. I was absolutely terrified. I didn't know whether to run, stand still or what.'
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Bailiff Simon Nutt </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >described Mrs Amor's behaviour as 'complete and utter anger, wild'.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >The jury heard tape recordings of two 999 calls Mrs Amor made to the police, in which she told the emergency operator: 'I will get violent if you don't remove them. There is this silly cow who stinks of a cheap scent. I want her out, she is polluting the atmosphere.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >'I am surprised these people haven't had their faces filled in years ago by people far less civilised than I.' </New>
<New PAsource="" >When police arrived Mrs Amor was dragged out of her house, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >arrested and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >handcuffed. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Her younger </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >daughter Charlotte, 15, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >rushed out into the drive waving a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >hockey stick</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, forcing a policeman to draw his Cs gas canister.
</New>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >In her evidence </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Amor, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >who also has a 13-year-old son Richard, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >insisted the shotgun had remained 'broken', </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >that she had never pointed it at anyone and had fetched it only to protect herself from the 'strangers' while she dialled 999. </New>
<New PAsource="" >'It is the Eleventh Commandment - do not point guns at people,' she explained.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >'I do have a slightly florid turn of phrase when I get going,' she added. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'I'm sure I was extremely offensive.'
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >But she accused the two bailiffs of concocting their story as a 'damage limitation exercise', claiming they had made procedural errors.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Amor</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, a former property developer who bought Wetherham Manor 20 years ago, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >cleared of one </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >charge </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of common assault but </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >convicted on two counts of </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >possessing a firearm </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >with intent to cause </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the bailiffs </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >fear </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >unlawful violence.

</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >Nick O'Brien, defending, claimed Mrs Amor had 'learnt her lesson', and that even though they lived in a big manor house </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the family </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >were in desperate </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >financial </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >trouble. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >His mitigation was interrupted </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >for </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >five </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >minutes when Mrs Amor </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >began sobbing loudly in the dock.
</Rewrite>

<New PAsource="" >'She is very much of the generation who believe in a stiff upper lip,' Mr O'Brien added.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >'She has found it very stressful to be tried in public, especially with certain neighbours with whom she is on bad terms sitting in court.'
</New>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Passing sentence, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Judge Jeremy Griggs said: </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >'You produced the weapon when you were extremely angry, and set out to prevent court bailiffs from going about their business.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >'Had you lived in a humble abode the court would deal with you very severely. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The fact that you are the lady </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >lives in </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >manor house does not give you </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >special </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >privileges.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >'Your behaviour that day was disgraceful, the example you set </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >your family was dishonourable </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >shameful. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >I would be falling in my duty if I </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >did </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >not impose </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >an </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >immediate custodial sentence.'
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >St Tudy was recently honoured as Britain's most community spirited village, but yesterday residents showed no sympathy for their neighbour.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >One woman who asked not be named said: 'They are like the worst ever family in the worst estate in Britain.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >'Just because they live in a £750,000 manor house doesn't matter. They have completely alienated the village. There will be a few glasses raised in celebration at this news.'
</New>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >The Amors' links with the village were soured after they opened their extensive gardens </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to the public </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >without permission, and eventually won a three-year planning dispute.
