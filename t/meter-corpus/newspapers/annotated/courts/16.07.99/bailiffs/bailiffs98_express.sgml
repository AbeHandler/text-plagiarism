<Verbatim PAsource="" >A LADY of the manor was jailed for nine months </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >for threatening </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >debt collectors </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >with a loaded shotgun </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >when they called at her 17th century mansion.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Yvonne Amor, 53, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >also shouted abuse at the bailiffs, accusing one of being a "tart" and of "polluting the atmosphere with cheap perfume". </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >And when </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >police </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >were called, her teenage daughter </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Charlotte </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >threatened them with </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a hockey stick.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >As </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mrs Amor </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was led </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >away to the cells yesterday, </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >Charlotte and sister Sophia wailed, "She didn't do it" - only for their mother to turn and boom in refined tones, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Remember you're an Amor".</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Moments earlier, she had been told by </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Judge Jeremy Griggs: </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >"Had you lived in a humble abode, the court would deal with you very severely. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The fact that you are the lady who lives in </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >manor house does not give you any </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >special </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >privileges."</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >The jury heard that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >bailiffs Jayne Thompson and Simon Nutt called at Wetherham Manor in </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >St Tudy, </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Cornwall, to </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >collect </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >£433 in </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >unpaid traffic fines </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >from Mrs Amor's </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >husband Richard.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >When the bailiffs ignored Mrs Amor's requests to "sod off", she stormed upstairs and returned with a double-barrelled shotgun.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >"I thought I was going to be shot," Mrs Thompson told Truro Crown Court. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >"I thought about my children. Mrs Amor kept referring to my perfume and my weight, calling me a prostitute and a whore."</New>


<New PAsource="" >Mrs Amor then made two 999 calls to police, shouting down the phone: "There is this silly cow who stinks of cheap scent. I want her out; she's polluting the atmosphere. She stinks like a tart."</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >As </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >police </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >arrived to take </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Amor </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >away in handcuffs, Charlotte, 15, rushed out waving a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >hockey stick, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >forcing a policeman to draw his CS spray canister.</New>


<New PAsource="" >In court, Mrs Amor admitted: "I do have a slightly florid turn of phrase when I get going. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >I'm sure I was extremely offensive." </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >She </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was convicted </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >two </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >firearms offences but </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >cleared of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >assault.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Defence counsel, Nick </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >O'Brien</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, said that even though they lived in a £750,000 manor house, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the family </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >were in desperate </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >financial </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >trouble. </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >"Mrs Amor is very much of the generation who believe in a stiff upper lip," he added.</New>
