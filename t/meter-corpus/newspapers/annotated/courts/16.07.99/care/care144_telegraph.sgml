<Verbatim PAsource="" >Pamela Coughlan, 55, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >said she felt 'totally vindicated' by the Appeal Court's decision </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >North and East Devon Health Authority </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >should not be allowed to move her from the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mardon House nursing home in Exeter where she has lived since 1993.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >"Nobody wants to have to rely on the NHS," she said, "But when you have worked all your life and paid taxes and National Insurance stamps, you do expect it to be there for you when you need it." </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Miss Coughlan, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who has needed round-the-clock </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >nursing care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >since being hit by a car in 1971, began her legal battle two years ago after being told the health authority wanted to close Mardon House.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >It had earlier given her a written assurance that she could stay them as long as she wanted.</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Miss Coughlan ploughed </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >savings, mostly made up of the £70,000 damages </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >she was awarded after the accident, into fighting the closure.</Rewrite>


<New PAsource="" >"The money couldn't have been put to a better purpose," she said, "I had to fight it because I was the only person here who is able to speak.</New>


<New PAsource="" >"The two other patients, who are far more fragile than me, would have been killed by the move. It was literally life and death. It was a battle that needed to be fought. We hope it will mean the health department will provide more residential places and more people will haves better life with nursing provided. I think we can all sleep slightly more easily now."</New>


<New PAsource="" >"The health authority's action was so unfair. It was so draconian. I think the decision was made for financial reasons because we were too expensive. We never could understand the position of the health authority.</New>


<New PAsource="" >"People have got to be looked after and to be nursed."</New>


<New PAsource="" >Miss Coughlan, a former art teacher, was left with no movement below her shoulders and only limited use of her wrists, but not her hands, after her accident and spent 22 years at the long-stay Newcourt hospital on the outskirts of Exeter. But in 1994 the health authority decided to convert the building for administrative use and some of the patients were moved into the newly-built Mardon House. Rumours of closure began within weeks. </New>
<New PAsource="" >But after Miss Coughlan wrote to the local NHS Trust </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >she was given a written assurance that she could stay at </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mardon House for life.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >However, by 1997 the trust proposed it should be shut down and Miss Coughlan moved into the care of the local authority's social services department. This meant she would be means tested and could have been made to pay for her own care.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Her case was backed by the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Royal College of Nursing </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >because it raised fundamental issues over the funding of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >long-term care. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Miss Coughlan </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >may now </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >get the vast </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >majority of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >her life savings back </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >after the court ruled that she should be awarded her costs.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Nicola </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mackintosh, her solicitor, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"She has lost an enormous amount of weight because of the stress of the case. It has been going on since December 1996 when the health authority first showed a potential purchaser around. "The case she has fought is about the future of the NHS. I think that as a result, the future of the NHS as a free service to all who need it is now assured. When I say 'free', we are all paying for it."</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >The ruling means that Miss Coughlan can stay in the place she regards as her home.</New>


<New PAsource="" >"It is ideal for me and I am happy here; after all, it was purpose-built," she said. "There should be more places like Mardon House across the country."</New>
