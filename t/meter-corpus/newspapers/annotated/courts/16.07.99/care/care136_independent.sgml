<Verbatim PAsource="" >PAMELA COUGHLAN </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >won her case before the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Appeal Court </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday but thousands more elderly people with similar needs were left uncertain about their position. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Medical organisations are confused by </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >the complex 60-page judgment, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >with the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Royal College of Nursing </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >coming close to calling a victory </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >that </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >would </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >end means testing </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for many people in nursing homes.</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Ms Coughlan </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >won her case on the basis that the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >North and East Devon health authority had misinterpreted </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >criteria for </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >providing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >long-term care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >on the NHS and that the authority had broken a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >promise </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to provide her with a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"home for life". </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >But the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Appeal Court, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >recognising the implications of the case, also ruled on the general issue of who is </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >eligible for free </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >nursing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >care.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >In their ruling </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the judges said where a patient's primary need for accommodation </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a health need, then the patient's nursing care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the responsibility of the NHS and not the local authority. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Christine Hancock general secretary of the RCN, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >seized on this as evidence that many of the 42,000 paying residents of nursing homes were being unlawfully charged. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Almost by definition, the primary need of the vast majority of people in nursing homes is a health one."</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >But a separate part of the judgment refers to </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >criteria, is sued </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >by the NHS </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in 1995, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >which distinguished between people needing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >specialist nursing care, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who came under the NHS, and those who required </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >general nursing care, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who were the social services' responsibility.</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Specialist care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >is that broadly needed by patients whose state of health is improving or deteriorating, and whose needs are therefore changing, and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >general care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >is provided to people whose condition is stable. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The three judges </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >upheld this distinction.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >They said: </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Nursing care for a chronically sick patient may in appropriate cases be provided by a local authority as a social service and the patient may be liable to meet the cost of that care according to the patient's means."</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >But if </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >North Devon </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >failed to interpret the distinction correctly it is highly likely other authorities have made similar errors. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >There is now an urgent need for the government to clarify the criteria - and any shifting of the boundary could have big financial implications for the NHS.</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Charities </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the RCN </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >say the situation is unfair because </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >nursing care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >provided in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >hospital is free </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >but similar care provided to the same patient in a nursing home is </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >means tested.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >On the other hand, altering it would be costly - </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >£220m </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >according to the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >RCN </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >but rising rapidly as more old people enter the homes over the next two decades - and it is the better off who would benefit, by saving their homes to hand on to their children.</New>
