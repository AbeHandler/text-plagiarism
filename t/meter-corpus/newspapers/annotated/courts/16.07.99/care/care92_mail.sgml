<Rewrite PAsource="" >A LANDMARK court ruling yesterday could condemn thousands of elderly people to forfeit their life savings to pay for nursing care.
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Judges backed the right of NHS chiefs to move health service patients into nursing homes where they would face means-testing by social service authorities and the prospect of massive bills.
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >The decision will affect more than 150,000 </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >mainly elderly </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >people who receive </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >long-term nursing care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and could save the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Government £22O million.


</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >The ruling came in the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >test case </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Pamela Coughlan </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >severely disabled </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in a 1971 road accident, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who had been threatened with eviction from her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >NHS nursing home Mardon House, Exeter, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >when it was threatened with closure.
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Master of the Rolls Lord Woolf and two </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >colleagues in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Appeal Court </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said her medical needs were so great that they should be cared for by the NHS and that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >North and East Devon Health Authority </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >could not shut </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the home </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >because it would </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >break </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a long. standing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >promise </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >she </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >could spend the rest of her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >life </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >there. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >But at the same time they ruled that the NHS did have the right to hand patients over to social services in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'appropriate cases'. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >That means </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >the great majority of those in nursing homes - infirm elderly patients </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who need </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >general </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >full-time </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >nursing </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >attention rather than detailed and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >specialist care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >- face the continued prospect of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >footing </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >their own </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >bills. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >judgment </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >overturned a High Court ruling that the NHS had </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >an absolute </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >duty to provide nursing care, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >which would have ensure </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >free </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >provision for all elderly people </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in nursing homes </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >at a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >cost </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >NHS </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >£22Omillion.
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >A </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Royal Commission </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >on </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >care </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >of the elderly delivered earlier this year </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said the state should pay the nursing element of the cost. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >The one hope for the elderly was a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Government </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >promise yesterday that It would </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >review </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the rules, which have stood for four years, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in the light of </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the ruling. </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >Lord Woolf warned that the new ruling amounted to a 'halfway house' between the extreme positions in which either the NHS had to pay for everyone or everyone had to pay for themselves. </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >At present those patients who move from hospital care into a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >nursing home </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >come under the responsibility of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >social services </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >departments run by local councils. </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >They must pay the bills for their own residential care - from £250 a week upwards - and also the bill for their nursing, a further £100 or more.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Social workers operate a Government-set means test under which anyone with more than £16,000 in assets and savings must pay all their own bills. The state will only pay the whole bill when savings fall below £10,000.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >This system often results in elderly people having to sell their homes to meet the bills.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Lord Woolf, Lord Justice Mummery and Lord Justice Sedley, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said firmly that the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >means-testing </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >system could continue. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'Nursing care for a chronically sick patient may in appropriate cases be provided by a local authority as a social service and the patient may be liable to meet the cost of that care according to the patient's means,' </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the ruling said.
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Health Secretary Frank Dobson </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >welcomed the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >judgment </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said it </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >would 'safeguard </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >tens of thousands of elderly and vulnerable people in nursing homes'.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >He added: 'The sole reason the Department of Health intervened in this case was to ask the court to clarify the powers of social services authorities to make arrangements for the provision of nursing care. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >It </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >confirms our understanding of the current legal position.'</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >But </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sally Greengross, director of Age Concern England, said: 'This ruling perpetuates a fundamental inequality within the health service whereby people in nursing homes have to pay for their nursing care when it is free everywhere else.
</Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >'Nursing care is rightfully a health responsibility and should be free to all those who need it.'
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >The </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Royal College of Nursing, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >however, which took a part in the case alongside the Department of Health, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >interpreted it differently. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >It said </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the judgment </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >threw the current rules into doubt and that thousands of patients would be able to get out of the means tested system and win free care. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >'Pamela </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Coughlan's brave decision to fight the closure of her home has brought her personal success but it should also bring an end to means-testing for tens of </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >thousands,' </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said general secretary Christine Hancock.
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >The judgment appears to set up </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a grey area </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >over who should be means-tested and who should receive free NHS nursing. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >A </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >paraplegic car crash </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >victim who needed </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >specialist care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and whose condition could change rapidly would certainly get free care. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >A frail elderly person needing general nursing care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for conditions like </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >bed sores </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >would have to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >pay. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >But the judgment does not make clear where a patient suffering from a medical </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >condition </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that is not </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >volatile </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >but does require intense care would stand, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >for </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >example, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Alzheimer's.
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >At present </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >157,500 people in England </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >receive </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >long-term nursing care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >42,500 pay their own </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >bills in full.
