<Rewrite PAsource="" >A WOMAN </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >paralysed </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >after </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a road accident </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >has lost her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >test case </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Court of Appeal </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to force the state to pay for all the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >long-term nursing care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >chronically sick and disabled. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >However, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Pamela Coughlan, 55, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >has stopped the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >NHS </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >from closing her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >nursing home.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >The </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Appeal Court judges ruled </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"the NHS does not have sole responsibility </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for all nursing care". </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Lord Woolf, Master of the Rolls, Lord Justice Mummery and Lord Justice Sedley </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >stated:</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Nursing care for a chronically sick patient may in appropriate cases be provided by a local authority as a social service and the patient may be liable to meet the cost of that care according to the patient's means."</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" > The ruling appeared to have increased confusion over who is responsible for funding long-term care. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Frank Dobson, the Health Secretary, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Royal College of Nursing </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >- who backed opposite sides in the legal battle - both expressed </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >delight </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >at the outcome.</Rewrite>


<New PAsource="" >The 38-page judgment stated that </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Coughlan</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >, a tetraplegic, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was entitled to free nursing care because her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >primary need for accommodation </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a health need </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >nursing </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >needs not </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'incidental'. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The judges </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >also </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >ruled </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >North and East Devon Health Authority </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >must reverse its decision to close the NHS-funded </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >home </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Exeter </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >where </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Coughlan lived, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and to transfer her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >care to social services, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >where she could have been </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >means-tested and charged for help and accommodation.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >The health authority's criteria to decide between nursing and social care </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >were unlawful, the </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >judgment </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >It added that the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >authority </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had contravened </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the European Convention on Human Rights </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in breaking a promise to Mrs </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Coughlan </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Exeter home would be her "home for life." </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mrs Coughlan welcomed the ruling. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >"We can all sleep more easily now," she said.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The RCN, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >which backed her case, claimed that the ruling had implications for people in nursing homes around the country. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >At present, people in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >nursing homes </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >are </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >means-tested </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and may have </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to pay for </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >their nursing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >care. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >But if they receive </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >nursing care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in their own </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >home, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a residential home or </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >hospital, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >it </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >is free.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Because so many </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >NHS long-term </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >care wards have been closed, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >thousands of elderly </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and chronically ill people now live in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >nursing homes. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Of the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >157,500 people </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >nursing </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >homes, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >42,500 pay for </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >all </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >their care </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >because their savings exceed the £16,000 threshold for receiving free care. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Christine Hancock, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >leader </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >of the RCN, said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that the ruling </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >should </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >mean an </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >end to means-testing for nursing care for </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >thousands </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >of people in nursing homes.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >'The judgment states that where a patient's primary need for accommodation is a health need, the patient's nursing care is the responsibility of the NHS and not the local authority,' </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Ms </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Hancock said.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >People in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >other health authorities </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >could now challenge the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >criteria </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >used in their areas for </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >nursing </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >needs, she added.</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Dobson </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was also pleased for entirely different reasons. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >Had the judges up held a High Court decision that the health service had an </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"</Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >absolute </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >duty" to </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >pay for all </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >long-term care, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >hundreds of thousands of people in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >nursing homes </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who are </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >means-tested </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and charged for nursing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >would have been entitled to claim it free. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Dobson </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said that his department had </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >intervened </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >only </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to ask the court to clarify the powers of social services authorities to make arrangements for the provision of nursing care.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >"This judgment confirms that social services authorities may make such arrangements."</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sally Greengross, of Age Concern, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said the ruling failed to clarify matters. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >She urged the Government to implement the recommendations of the royal commission on long term care to provide </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >free nursing care to all who </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >needed </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >it.</Verbatim>
