<Rewrite PAsource="" >THE Court of Appeal's judgement on who pays for long term nursing care, the state or the individual, has set out a principle but uncomfortably left the details to be 'resolved'.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >In the simplest terms, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Royal College of Nursing </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >believes that since nursing care meets a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >health need, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >it should always be free under 'the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >NHS</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The Department of Health </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >argues that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >long-term nursing care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >should not 'always be </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the responsibility of the NHS.'</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >The judgment has succeeded in apparently meeting both positions and has left both camps rejoicing,  </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >But it also forces the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Department of Health to clarify </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the difference between </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >specialist </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >general nursing care.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >The judgment says </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >that 'Where a </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >person's </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >need for "accommodation </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and support" is primarily to meet their </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >health </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >needs, as in the case of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Pamela Coughlan, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >it should be free.' </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >But it also says that social services departments as well as the health service may be the providers.</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The Royal College of Nursing </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >interprets this as a victory and argues that anyone in a nursing home is there primarily for their health needs. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >If this was not the case they could be cared for adequately in a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >residential home </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and could therefore be </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >'means tested'.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The judgment rules that where a patient's primary "need is a health need" then 'the patient's nursing care is the responsibility of the NHS. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Almost by definition the primary need of the vast majority of people in nursing homes is a health one,' said Christine Hancock, general secretary </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >RCN.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >On this basis the college says that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >42,500 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >people now contributing to their nursing home care should not be doing so. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >The potential bill to the NHS amounts to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >#220 million a year.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >An RCN spokesman said that unless there is rapid clarification from the Department of health there will be "chaos" and countless court cases as families refuse to pay and argue that care should be free.</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >But the Law Lords also </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >upheld </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >1995 guidance </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that the health service is responsible for </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"specialist" </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >nursing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >social services </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >departments should be responsible for </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"general" </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >nursing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >care.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >On this basis </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Frank Dobson, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Health Secretary, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >has also warmly welcomed the ruling and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Department of Health </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >says that there are no extra cost implications for the health service.</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >'This judgment confirms that social services authorities may make such arrangements and confirms our understanding of the current
position,' </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >he said yesterday.</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The NHS Confederation represents health authorities </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and trusts, the NHS bodies which have to find the beds and the money for the services.</New>


<New PAsource="" >It is stuck in the middle. "At this stage I frankly do not know if this is going to cost the NHS more and I have just written to Frank Dobson seeking urgent clarification," said Stephen Thornton, chief executive of the confederation.</New>


<New PAsource="" >"The RCN's argument is perfectly logical. At the same time the Department of Health lawyers are taking the view that the judgment does not change the position we have at present," he said,</New>


<New PAsource="" >"There is still the historical anomaly that nursing care is free in hospital or at home but citizens pay for it if they have to go into a nursing home. In the long run this cannot be the best way to organise care," he said.</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >The Department of Health has said it will </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >review </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the situation </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in the light of </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday's </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >judgment. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Mr Thornton questioned the need for a review if the department believes that nothing has changed.</New>


<New PAsource="" >"The devil will be in the detail of the interpretation. Our concern is that in the course of the review there may be a lowering of the entry criteria for free nursing care and that would have financial implications for the NHS," he said.</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Had the judges come to the conclusion that the NHS must carry the burden of all nursing care provided in nursing homes, the NHS could have been bankrupted this year, he said.</Rewrite>


<New PAsource="" >This seems a very sensible judgment that makes clear that the NHS is not responsible for paying for all nursing care provided in nursing homes' Mr Thornton added.</New>
