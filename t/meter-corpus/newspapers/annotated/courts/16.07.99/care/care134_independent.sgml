<New PAsource="" >THOUSANDS OF elderly people will be forced to sell their homes </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to pay for their care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in nursing homes because a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Court of Appeal judgment on long-term health care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >found in favour of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Government </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >However, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Master of the Rolls Lord Woolf and two other judges dismissed the appeal by a health authority against the ruling that its closure of a care home was unlawful.</Verbatim>



<Verbatim PAsource="" >Charities </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for the elderly said they were disappointed by the ruling, which spared </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Government </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >an estimated </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >£220m year </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >NHS bills, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and contradicted </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >proposals from the Royal Commission on Long term Care, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >which said that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >medical and personal care should be free. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >The ruling means </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the NHS can </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >continue to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >shift responsibility </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for paying </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >for long-term nursing care to local authorities </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >can then means test patients.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >While patients can get </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >free </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >NHS </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >nursing care in hospital </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >those in nursing homes with assets of more than £16,000 are forced to pay. </New>
<New PAsource="" >There are currently 480,000 old people living in homes: </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >157,500 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of them are in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >long-term nursing </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >homes, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >of whom 42,500 pay for their care.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Every year an estimated 40,000 people have to sell their homes to fund long-term care.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sally Greengross, director general of Age Concern, said: "This ruling perpetuates a fundamental inequality within the health service: the anomaly whereby people in nursing homes have had to pay for their nursing care when it is free everywhere else.</Verbatim>

	
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"Nursing care is rightfully a health responsibility and Age Concern has long argued that nursing care should be free at the point of delivery to all those who need it, wherever they live. This judgment will add to the confusion which characterises the long-term health system."</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Frank Dobson, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the Secretary of State for Health, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >joined the legal battle after the High Court decided, last December, that the NHS has a legal duty to provide free long-term general nursing care. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >He </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >said he was "delighted" </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >with </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Court of Appeal judgment.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Pamela Coughlan brought the case against North and East Devon Health Authority over its decision to close Mardon House NHS nursing home in Exeter, where she had lived since 1993 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and which was described to her as </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"a home for life". </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Ms Coughlan, 55, who was paralysed in a road accident in 1971, and two other residents were told they would be moved to local authority residential homes and that the social services would be responsible for them.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The appeal judges agreed that the decision by the health authority to close Mardon House was unlawful because it depended on a "misinterpretation" of its responsibilities under the Health Act </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"an unjustified breach of a clear promise given by the health authority to Ms Coughlan that she should have a home for life". </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Ms Coughlan, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who has </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >spent her life savings </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >fighting </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the case, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >should get most of the money back, her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >solicitor said </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday.</Rewrite>


<New PAsource="" >Gail Elkington, the policy officer at </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Help the Aged, said: "This is good news for Ms Coughlan, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >whose care will now be paid for, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >but </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >unfortunately it is not going to alter the funding arrangements of vulnerable older people in nursing care.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >"Everyday, health and local authorities are squabbling over who pays for long-term care, and older people are caught in the middle. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >We were hoping this case </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >could </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >clarify the situation but the </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >muddle continues."</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Stephen Thornton, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents all health authorities, said: "If it had gone the other way it could have bankrupted the NHS. But the criteria for who receives NHS-funded long-term nursing care needs to be clarified and the judgment does not make that clear."</Verbatim>
