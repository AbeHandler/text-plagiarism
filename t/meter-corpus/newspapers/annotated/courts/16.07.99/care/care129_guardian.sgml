<New PAsource="" >Pamela Coughlan had embarked on a London university external law degree when the chance came to get some practical experience. </New>
<New PAsource="" >She put her books aside for two years to fight her own legal battle against the health authority which threatened to renege </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >on a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >promise to her and two other </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >disabled </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >residents </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of an NHS </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >home </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Exeter.
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >When she returns to her course after a two-year break she will find her own landmark judgment; R v North and East Devon health authority, ex parte Pamela Coughlan, listed among the leading cases. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Paralysed from the </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >neck </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >down </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >since she was hit by a car on her way to work in </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >1971, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >she and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >two </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >other severely disabled long-term patients were </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >promised </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >"a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >home for life" </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >at </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mardon House, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >an NHS rehabilitation centre, when they agreed to move there in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >1993. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >But only a few years later the health authority decided </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to close the home </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and find alternative accommodation for </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Ms Coughlan and </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >her fellow </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >residents.
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >The authority agreed to fund their care </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >for life </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >but </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Ms Coughlan </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was angry that it was reneging on </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >its promise </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and depriving her of her home. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >She got </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >legal aid </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >but risked forfeiting her capital of £6O,OOO - </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >compensation for her accident - </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >to the legal aid board had she lost the case.
</New>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Yesterday the court of appeal </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >upheld </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >a high court </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >ruling that the authority had acted </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >unlawfully. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >There was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >unfairness amounting to an abuse of power by the health authority," said Lord Woolf, Master of the Rolls. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Ms Coughlan, 55, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was awarded </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >costs.
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >But the ramifications of her case went much further than she or NHS managers could have expected. During the 1990s, large numbers of long stay hospitals closed, and health authorities nationwide transferred patients needing indefinite care to local authority nursing homes.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Responsibility for nursing care in such homes fell on local authorities, not the NHS, which remained responsible for care provided in hospitals and in patients' own homes. </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >This created an </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >anomaly, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >because </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >social services care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >is </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >means tested, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and patients who can afford to pay are charged, while NHS care </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >is free.
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >When </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Ms Coughlan </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >took her case to the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >high court last year, Mr Justice Hidden </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >ruled that health authorities had misinterpreted the law. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Nursing care was health care and solely the responsibility of the NHS, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >he said.
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >The </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >three appeal court judges </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who gave judgment yesterday on the health authority appeal decided that was wrong. </Rewrite>
<New PAsource="" >Local authorities could provide nursing services, they said, but only those which formed part of the "package of care" expected to be provided by a local council. No precise legal line could be drawn; it would depend on the "nature and scale" of the services.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Nursing care for Ms Coughlan, who requires round-the-clock help, and a fellow resident who is doubly incontinent; immobile and unable to communicate, was the NHS's responsibility Help with feeding and bathing would presumably be part of the social services' care package. But there are bound to be cases between, where health authorities could face numerous legal challenges.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >The judges acknowledged that unfairness was built into the statutory scheme, because those cared for in nursing homes had to pay, while those in their own homes or hospital got free nursing services.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >The royal commission on long term care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >recommended last </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >March </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that nursing and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >personal care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for the elderly </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >should be </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >provided </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >free </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >without means testing.
