<Rewrite PAsource="" >A </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >WOMAN paralysed in a road accident </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >won a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Court of Appeal </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >victory yesterday that should ensure free </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >long-term nursing care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for many of the chronically disabled while sparing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Government hundreds of millions of pounds a year </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >extra </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >National Health Service </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >costs.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Lord Woolf, the Master of the Rolls, and two other judges dismissed </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >an </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >appeal by a health authority against a High Court ruling that it had </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >acted </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >unlawfully </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in deciding </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to close </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >one of its homes where </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Pamela Coughlan </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had been told she could spend the rest </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >of her life.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >But the three judges </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >went on to rule that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Justice Hidden, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the trial </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >judge </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Miss Coughlan's </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >case, had been wrong in deciding that all </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >nursing care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was the sole </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >responsibility of the NHS </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >acting through health authorities and that this burden could not be transferred </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to local </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >authority </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >social services </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >departments, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >which can means-test patients.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >The "critical issue", they said, was whether </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >nursing care for a chronically </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >ill </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >patient may be provided </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >lawfully </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >by a local authority as a social service, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >with </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the patient </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >paying </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >according to means, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >or whether it had to be provided free of charge as part of the NHS.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >They went on to rule that some </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >long-term nursing care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >could be provided lawfully in local authority nursing homes and sought to lay down guidelines on where the line should be drawn between lawfully provided local authority nursing services, for which residents could be charged, and free nursing care under the NHS.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >But there were widely different interpretations on the judgment, with the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Royal College of Nursing </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >claiming that it </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >could herald the end of means-testing for long-term </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >nursing care, while the Government welcomed the ruling as saving the NHS from a crippling extra costs burden.</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Justice Hidden's </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >ruling in the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >High Court </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >last December </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >that nursing was "health care" </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and could never be "social care" was seen as putting a stop to the widespread practice of health authorities seeking to claim that </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >long-term nursing care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >responsibility of social services.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >It led to the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Health Secretary, Frank Dobson, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >intervening to back the appeal by the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >North and East Devon Health Authority.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >At the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >appeal hearing in May </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >its lawyers claimed that if the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >High Court </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >ruling was allowed to stand, it would cost the Government </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"hundreds of millions of pounds a year" in </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >extra </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >NHS </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >costs.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Yesterday's judgment was another </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >victory for Miss Coughlan, 55, who was paralysed </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for life </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >in a road accident in 1971 </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and who had brought her legal challenge </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >after the health authority decided to close Mardon House in Exeter, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >which she had been told would be her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >home for life.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Dismissing the appeal, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Lord Woolf </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who was sitting with </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Lord Justice Mummery and Lord Justice Sedley, said the decision to close Mardon House was unlawful because it depended on a "misinterpretation" of </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the health authority's </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >responsibilities under the Health Act.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Criteria adopted by the authority for long-term NHS health care were unlawful and the decision to shut the home was "an unjustified breach of a clear promise given by the health authority to Miss Coughlan that she should have a home for life".</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >This constituted "unfairness amounting to an abuse of power", which would be a breach of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >They ordered the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >health authority </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to pay </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >all </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Miss Coughlan's legal costs, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >which means she will recover more than £65,000 she had to pay to bring her legal challenge before she became eligible for full legal aid.</New>


<New PAsource="" >In their reserved judgment, the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >three judges, said </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >the "critical issue" in the appeal was whether </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >nursing care for a chronically ill patient may </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >lawfully </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >be provided by a local authority as a social service, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in which case the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >patient </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >paid </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >according to means, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >or whether it was to be provided free by the NHS.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >If Mr Justice Hidden's decision was right, it would have significant financial consequences for the Health Secretary and the authority and would mean that the minister's policy on nursing care was unlawful.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >It would also mean that those receiving nursing care while residing in a nursing or similar home provided by a local authority would be entitled to have that care provided free of charge.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >If the judge was wrong, the nursing services would have to be paid for, unless the patient's financial resources had been nearly exhausted.</Rewrite>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The three appeal judges </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said they did not accept the trial judge's conclusion that all </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >nursing care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >must be the sole </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >responsibility of the NHS </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and had to be provided by the health authority.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Whether the nursing care could be provided by the local authority had to be determined on an assessment of individual circumstances.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >In ruling that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the NHS does not have sole responsibility for all nursing care, the judges </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >said </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >nursing care for "a chronically sick patient may in appropriate cases be provided by a local authority as a social service and the patient may be liable to meet the cost of that care according to the patient's means".</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >The provisions of the National Health Service Act 1977 </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and the 1990 NHS and Community Care Act did </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >not make it necessarily unlawful for the health authority to decide to transfer responsibility for Miss Coughlan's general nursing care to the local authority's social services.</Verbatim>


<New PAsource="" >Whether it was unlawful depended on whether the nursing services were "merely incidental or ancillary to the provision of accommodation which a local authority is under a duty to provide" and "of a nature" which a local authority providing social services could be expected to provide.</New>


<New PAsource="" >Miss Coughlan needed "services of a wholly different category", said the three judges in applying these guidelines to her case. </New>
