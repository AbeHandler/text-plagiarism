<Verbatim PAsource="" >The NHS </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >has been saved </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >hundreds of millions of pounds </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >after </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the court of appeal </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >yesterday </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >ruled </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that the service did not have to ensure free care for all elderly people in nursing homes.
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >The </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >appeal court ruled </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the NHS does not have sole responsibility for </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >all </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >nursing care - the patient may be liable to meet the cost of that care according to the patient's means. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >More than 150,000 </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >elderly people </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >receive </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >long-term nursing care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and could be affected. </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >The </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >court </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >upheld 1995 guidance </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >sent </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to health authorities </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >which states that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the NHS can shift responsibility for some long-term nursing care to local authorities, which can </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >pass on the costs to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >patients </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >if they have the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >means </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to pay.
</Rewrite>

<New PAsource="" >Ministers claimed the ruling would safeguard funds for those patients who really needed NHS nursing home care. </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >The </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >health secretary, Frank Dobson, said he was "delighted" </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >at the outcome of the appeal, which was against a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >high court </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >judgment which could have landed the health service with an even bigger bill of 220m.
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >The ruling means the NHS will have to pick up the nursing bill for some nursing home residents with extensive care needs currently met by social services or from their own resources. But where the line will be drawn is by no means clear.
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Stephen Thornton, chief executive of the NHS confederation, said: "If it had gone the other way it could have bank rupted the NHS and therefore we are pleased. But the devil is in the detail. The existing criteria for who receives NHS funded long-term nursing care need to be clarified".
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >The government will now have to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >review </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >department of health </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >guidance. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >The distinction will be crucial because, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >although </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >NHS care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >is </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >free, care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >provided by </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >local authorities </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >is means-tested.
</Rewrite>

<New PAsource="" >In the meantime, health authorities are bracing themselves for a rash of legal challenges.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >North and East Devon Health Authority </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had appealed </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >against a ruling by a high court </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >judge, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Justice Hidden, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >December </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >1998 </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >that it </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had acted </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >unlawfully </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >in deciding </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to close </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >an </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >NHS home - Mardon House in Exeter - </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and move three long-term disabled </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >residents </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >into community care.
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >The decision was challenged by one of the residents, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Pamela Coughlan, 55, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who is in a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >wheelchair, paralysed from the </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >neck </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >down </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >following </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a road, accident in 1971.
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >She is doubly incontinent and has difficulty breathing because her respiratory tract is partly paralysed.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Mr Justice Hidden ruled that nursing care was </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >always </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >health care </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and could never be social care, </New>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and that therefore the health service must pick up the bill in full.
</Rewrite>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >Yesterday </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Lord Woolf, Master of the Rolls, Lord Justice Mummery and Lord Justice Sedley </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >disagreed with Mr Justice Hidden.
</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >A </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >spokeswoman </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >for Help the Aged said: </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >"Every day health and local authorities are squabbling over who pays for long-term care and older people are caught in the middle. </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >We were hoping this case would clarify the situation, but the muddled mess continues", </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Christine Hancock, general secretary </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Royal College of Nursing, said: "The simplest, fairest and most cost effective solution would be to entitle all those assessed as needing long-term nursing care to receive that care free under the NHS wherever it is provided." </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Ms Coughlan said she was "pleased and delighted" with the appeal court ruling.
