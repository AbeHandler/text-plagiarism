<Rewrite PAsource="" >A PARAPLEGIC </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >woman </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >won a landmark legal judgment yesterday, putting </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >pressure </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >on </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Government to clarify </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who should pick up the bill for </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the long-term nursing care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >sick </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >elderly.</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Pam Coughlan, 55, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who is </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >paralysed from the waist down </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >after </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a road accident, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >launched a court battle after her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >local health authority </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >tried to break its promise of a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"home for life" </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >close Mardon House in Exeter. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >It wanted to move her from the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >NHS care home </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >to a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >social services home, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >where she would have to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >pay for </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >her </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >care. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Miss Coughlan </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >won a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >High Court </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >challenge </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >last December</Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >, but </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the health authority </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >appealed, </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >backed </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >by </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Health Secretary Frank Dobson.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Now the issue of who should </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >pay for long-term care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >has been thrown into chaos after </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Court of Appeal </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >found that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the health authority </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >acted unlawfully deciding </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >to close Mardon House, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >saying </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Miss Coughlan </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was entitled to keep her savings rather than using them to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >pay for care. </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >But </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the judges </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >ruled that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the NHS </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >should only </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >pay for </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >some - not all - </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >long-term nursing care, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >which would </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >cost the Government an </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >estimated </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >£220million a year.</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >The ruling means that people receiving care in </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >social services homes </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >will still be </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"means tested" </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >and may be </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >forced to pay </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >up to £500 a week for care.</New>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Mr </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Dobson said he was "delighted" </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >with the decision. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >But </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >charities </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >and </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Royal College of Nursing, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >which backed </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Ms Coughlan, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >called for urgent </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >clarification </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >criteria </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for receiving </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >free </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >nursing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >care, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >adding that the current situation was an </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"absurd anomaly".</Verbatim>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >They want </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >the Government to implement </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >the recommendation of a </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Royal Commission </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >into </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >long-term care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >earlier this year that all nursing </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >should be free </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >regardless of where it is provided.</Rewrite>


<Rewrite PAsource="" >Currently, 42,000 of the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >157,500 people </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >receiving </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >long-term nursing care </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >have to </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >pay </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >up to £500 a week from their savings. </New>
<New PAsource="" >Anyone with assets of £10,000 or more, including the value of their homes, has to contribute towards the cost of social services run homes, while those with £16,000 get no help at all.</New>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Sally Greengross, director of Age Concern, said: "This ruling perpetuates a fundamental inequality within the health service - the anomaly whereby people in nursing homes have had to pay for their nursing care when it is free everywhere else. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >This judgment will add to the confusion." </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >But the Royal College of Nursing claimed the </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >ruling </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >could herald the end of means testing for long-term health patients. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >General secretary Christine Hancock said: "The Judgement clearly states that North and East Devon Health Authority's eligibility criteria for long-term NHS health care were unlawful. </Verbatim>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >It rules that where a patient's primary need for accommodation is a health need, then the patient's nursing care is the responsibility of the NHS."</Verbatim>


<Verbatim PAsource="" >Ms Coughlan, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >who </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >was too ill to travel from Devon to hear the judgment in London, has spent her life savings </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >on the case. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >She will </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >get </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >most </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >of the money back </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >after the health authority was ordered to pay her costs.</New>


<New PAsource="" >A Health Department spokeswoman said criteria on who should receive NHS funded care was under review. New guidelines are expected by the end of the year.</New>
