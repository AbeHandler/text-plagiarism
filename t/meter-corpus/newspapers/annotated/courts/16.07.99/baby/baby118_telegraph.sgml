</Rewrite>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Craig Coleman, 30, </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >would previously have been charged with a lesser offence of assault under the </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"year and a day </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >rule</Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >" </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >which came into being in the 13th century.
</New>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >In the past, a person could not be accused of being the killer if the victim died more than 366 days after the incident. </Rewrite>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >The </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >law </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >was </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >changed </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >after a campaign by a mother whose son died in similar circumstances to those of Coleman's four-month-old son and namesake.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Coleman </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >became the </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >first </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >grievous bodily harm with intent on his son. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >When the baby later died, Coleman was charged, in his prison cell, with murder.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >A three-year campaign by Pat Gibson, a mother from Co Durham whose 22-year-old son died 16 months after an unprovoked attack, led to the change in law, which was introduced in June, 1997.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >After Craig's death, the Crown Prosecution Service applied to the Attorney General to bring a prosecution under the new Act.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Coleman picked Craig up by the ears and shook him until his brain bled after being left with the boy by his girlfriend, Deborah Brown, while she went to work as a store assistant.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >The baby died as a result of meningitis and pneumonia brought on by his injuries.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Coleman, an out-of-work security guard, of Forbes Avenue, Middlesbrough, had claimed that his son was choking and he shook him to help him to breathe. He insisted that he had not intended to harm the child.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >He had originally pleaded not guilty but, after a meeting in the cells with his mother, he admitted murdering his son.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >Aidan Marron, QC, </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >for </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Coleman, said: "This is a unique case. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Currently there have been no cases where a person has died outside the year and a day rule.
</New>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >"No one has been </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >convicted of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >this offence (grievous bodily harm with intent) and subsequently </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >convicted of </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >murder.
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >"It was </New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >a few moments </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >of madness </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >on a weary winter's morning </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >when he </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >lost control of himself. </Verbatim>
<New PAsource="" >Death will have come to the baby as a merciful release. </New>
<New PAsource="" >This child has passed from a living death into an actual death.</New>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >"
</Verbatim>

<Rewrite PAsource="" >He said that </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >Coleman </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >had repeatedly burnt the child's </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >name into his </Verbatim>

<Verbatim PAsource="" >awake at night </Verbatim>
<Rewrite PAsource="" >so that he could continually </Rewrite>
<Verbatim PAsource="" >think about the child.
</Verbatim>

<New PAsource="" >In a letter Coleman wrote: "I just can't relax. I still talk to my beautiful son Craigie I just feel dead. I can't really stand myself. I just feel like scum. I wish I was dead. I am praying to God to let me go to Craigie,"
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Mrs Gibson welcomed the landmark case.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >Her son Michael died 16 months after being attacked in his home town in April, 1992.
</New>

<New PAsource="" >His attacker David Clark was charged with assault,' causing grievous bodily harm, and served half of a two-year sentence.
