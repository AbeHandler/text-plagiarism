AN avenging wife who hired a hitman to murder her husband with a crowbar as he lay asleep in bed was jailed for three years yesterday.

But mother-of-two Sandra Jones, 39, was spared a longer sentence after husband Clifford, 36, pleaded for mercy.

He said after the case at Stafford Crown Court: 'My feelings have never changed about her. Who knows what the future might hold for us?'

Jones, from Uttoxeter, Staffs, claimed her husband beat her.

Her co-conspirator and friend Julie Harvey, 34, was jailed for 18 months for her part in the bungled plot.

Hitman Matthew Lee, 53, already a convicted killer, was jailed for life.
