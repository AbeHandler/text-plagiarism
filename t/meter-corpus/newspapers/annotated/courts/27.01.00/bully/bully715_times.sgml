John Stratford, 28, an Army sergeant from Wavertree, Liverpool, appeared before magistrates in Hexham, Northumberland, charged with six counts of common assault on cadets at a training camp and possessing an offensive weapon. The charges follow allegations made by parents that teenagers were assaulted during a two-week training exercise at Redesdale Camp, Otterburn, last August. The hearing was adjourned.
