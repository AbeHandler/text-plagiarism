Anthony Willis, 47, a former Buckingham Palace footman, was spared a prison sentence after he admitted threatening to kill Lynn Freeman, 22, a Palace clerk who was his former lover. Willis told Middlesex Guildhall Crown Court that he 'flipped' when he discovered that Ms Freeman had begun a relationship with another royal servant. He was put on probation for a year.
