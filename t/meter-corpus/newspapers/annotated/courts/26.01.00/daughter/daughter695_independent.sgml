A MOTHER was criticised by mental health campaigners yesterday for making a 'judgement based on fear' after she won a landmark legal battle which will allow her to proceed with the hysterectomy of her mentally handicapped daughter to protect her from unwanted pregnancy.

The mother, 54, a widow, claimed the operation was the most effective way for her daughter, 28, to be fully protected from an unwanted pregnancy.

The case was contested at the High Court in London on behalf of the woman's daughter, identified only by the initial S, by the Official Solicitor, Laurence Oates, who argued that the hysterectomy was not necessary.

But the ruling by one of the country's most senior High Court family judges, Mr Justice Wall, was rounded on last night by mental health charity Mencap, which condemned the operation as 'an extreme measure' based on social not health grounds.

David Congdon, director of public affairs for Mencap said: 'Mencap believes that a hysterectomy is only in a person's best interests if based on health rather then social grounds.

'Although such cases are difficult, the judge seems to have placed excessive emphasis on social concerns and we can see little medical justification for such an extreme measure.'
