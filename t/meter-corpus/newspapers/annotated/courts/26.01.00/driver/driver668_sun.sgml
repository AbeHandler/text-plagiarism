A DISTRAUGHT dad hit out yesterday after a drink-driver who killed his daughter was jailed for just four months.

Norman Yeomans said he was 'disgusted' at the sentence on James Billman, 22. The driver ploughed into Norman's daughter Lorna, 15, as she walked home with friends in Norwich.

Billman, of Dereham, Norfolk, had drunk four pints in the pub before the horror. He fled the scene and 'drank himself into oblivion' before finally turning himself in the next day.

Billman was also banned from driving for two years by Norwich magistrates.

Mr Yeomans said: 'I am disgusted with what will amount to two months in prison for killing my daughter.'

He said he was considering a civil action against Billman, who had never made any apology to the family.
