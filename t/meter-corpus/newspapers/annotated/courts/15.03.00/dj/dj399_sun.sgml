FORMER Radio 1 DJ Chris Denning was jailed for 4 1/2 years yesterday for sexually abusing under-age boys.

Denning, 58, from Bracknell, Berks, was found guilty on seven out of ten charges in the Czech capital Prague.

Homosexual Denning helped launch Radio 1 in 1967, but quit the Midday Spin show in 1969 to work in advertising.

Two Frenchmen and an American were jailed for three years on similar charges. All four will be deported once released.
