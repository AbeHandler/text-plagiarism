THE MOTHER of a four-month-old girl whose body was found in a canal has been charged with her baby's murder. Robina Hashim, 29, was due to appear before magistrates in Burnley, Lancashire, charged with murdering Emma-Jade Dyson. The baby's body was found in the Leeds-Liverpool canal, a short distance from the family's home, after Ms Hashim told police she had been taken from a pushchair outside a supermarket.
