A MAN'S conviction in an alleged road rage case has been quashed after it emerged that a magistrate had fallen asleep during the trial, the Crown Prosecution Service said yesterday.

Timothy Price must face a retrial next month after his solicitor reported the incident during the hearing at Witney Magistrates' Court in Oxfordshire.

The sleeping magistrate has not been identified.

Mr Price had been convicted of causing fear and provocation of violence following the alleged incident.

He was fined £500 and ordered to pay £300 in compensation.

'It is only fair to have a retrial,' said his solicitor Tim Brown.
