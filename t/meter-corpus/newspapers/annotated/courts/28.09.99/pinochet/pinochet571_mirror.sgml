FORMER Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet was challenged yesterday to attend court and fight charges of torturing opponents. Pinochet, 83, has stayed away while the Spanish government tries to have him extradited.

Alun Jones, representing Spain, said he would welcome the chance to cross-examine Pinochet.

But Cilve Nicholls QC, for the General, told Bow Street Magistrates' Court, London, that Pinochet was never 'personally involved' in torturing.

Julian Knowles, also defending, said: 'There is nothing to suggest this is anything more than police brutality which you get in Chile, Spain and, to some extent, the UK.' The case continues.
