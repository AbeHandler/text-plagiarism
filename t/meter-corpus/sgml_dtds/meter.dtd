       DTD info:     The format of the annotation is such that each meter document consists
                     of either 1 or no title and a body. The title is not a mandatory tag 
                     as not all articles will have one. The title must, however, come BEFORE 
                     the annotated text. The meter document has attributes, not all of which 
                     are required. PA texts will have "PA" as the newspaper attribute. Values 
                     for attributes can be left blank if unknown. The body of the meter document
                     consists of either 0 or more occurrences of either verbatim, rewrite and 
                     new tags with CDATA in any order, or just PCDATA. 

                     ALL tags require a start AND end tag
